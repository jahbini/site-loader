<p>Dizzy's real name is Discernment of the Higher Good, and is an archetype, too.  Dizzy is always there for the Fool, but most of what Dizzy says goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>Dizzy seldom talks, but rather dances his messages, and The Fool can't figure that out.  Hence the name Dizzy.</p>
<p>The movie "The Fifth Element" referred to the traditional four elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.  In western metaphysical tradition, these are approximately the same as Swords, Pentacles, Wands, and Cups.  The fifth element of the movie: Love, is our "discernment."</p>
