(Tommy's morphable truths number 2533 -- Saying is not the same as doing. Do what ever you damn well need. Say what they need to hear.) (Roger's rulebook number 2533 -- I got no dog in that fight. I do what I do, you do what you do.)(Southwick's reading on the entrails of the roadkill squirrel -- Gifts of nature overpower mere conventions.)(Unibrow's unwritten laws #1 -- I know some people who are into that. Not me, I'm clean though. Lemme know what you want.)(Concensus Sally's obliques' #22 "Good Job! Thanks for sharing, are we ready for a vote?")
