<p><span >The House at 3 Gunas Lp belongs to Tommy.&nbsp; Actually, it might be called Tommy, OR in honor of of the first citizen.&nbsp; There are lots of these Tommy, OR homes.&nbsp; Mostly, these are old-growth families, pre-60's locals.&nbsp; They have come a long way from their old public behaviors, but the values of the working class of that time rules:&nbsp; &quot;It's my RIGHT to open a chain-saw recreation area!&quot; , and of course, &quot;The river cleans itself.&quot;&nbsp; Fifty years later, it still is there.&nbsp; I remember it.&nbsp; It's in my roots too.&nbsp; Deep change takes time.</span></p>
<p ><span >Southwick tells me that Tommy's &quot;sweetheart&quot; of Great Harvest Moon fame has been calling: The story that ended in the primate cage: Ook-Ook.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >I congratulate Southwick on finally making a connection, but Southwick said she kind of didn't like Tibetan Poetry, the calls were not for him.&nbsp; She wants Tommy to come over to her house because her boyfriend is in jail for breaking the restraining order.&nbsp; &quot;<em>Tommy, stallion, it is safe to come over, Hmmm, Please?</em>&quot; &nbsp; The last telephone message actually had the boyfriend break in and say: &quot;I thought you weren't calling that guy anymore.... <em>Oh, I'm not.</em>&quot;</span></p>

<p ><span >In the unincorporated areas called Tommy, OR, some women stage chimp fights for their friends and neighbors to bet on.&nbsp; Enrage those bantams, lady!&nbsp; New guy wins, house wins.&nbsp; Boyfriend wins, house wins.&nbsp; The house always wins.</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >I tell Southwick that he is lucky she isn't calling him, and add that he won't get very far with that sanskrit poetry crap.</span></p>

<p >I think the house at 3 Gunas Lp needs a symbol.&nbsp; Like a little icon.&nbsp; Or a logo or something.&nbsp; I imagine that it would be Zeus riding a high-tech motorcycle with panties on the handlebars as trophies.&nbsp; Let me, <em>St. John's Jim</em>, assure you, the trophies really do hang on the fence at 3 Gunas Lp.&nbsp; Why Zeus?&nbsp; If you ask Tommy he would say the image fits.&nbsp; Maybe Chimp-Zeus. &nbsp;Helmet? &nbsp;Hell, NO -- &nbsp;Zeus has an aura for protection.&nbsp; Giant redwoods are broken twigs under the wheels. &nbsp;Got any ideas, [First Name]?</p>

<p ><span >It is sweet Sunday and I'm sitting in the James John Cafe. &nbsp;There is a young couple just behind me as I write this.&nbsp; She is giving him the slow but unmistakeable thaw.&nbsp; He is doing most of the talking. &quot;Hermit of Pentacles,&quot; &quot;higher vibrations,&quot; &quot;quantum geometry of the Aztecs&quot; --</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >I mumble to myself: &quot;Hmm.&nbsp; Quoting the Tibetan Poetry all wrong.&nbsp; It doesn't even make sense.</span>&quot;</p>

<p ><span >My thoughts turn to Portland as the city of rebirth.&nbsp; It is the City that Works.&nbsp; And what about St. John's?&nbsp; When will it work?&nbsp; I think I've found something in the North End Gallery.&nbsp; I've been invited behind the curtain as this giant egg begins to hatch a phoenix.&nbsp; The phoenix of St. John's?&nbsp; Possibly.&nbsp; Hopefully.&nbsp; Even though Hope never made it to Washington, DC.&nbsp; It might make it to St. John's.&nbsp; That's the hope.</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >It is a singularity ready to big it's bang onto our community.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted.</span></p>
