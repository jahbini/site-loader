Rate the Pubs Department:

{{{First Name}}}, You might want to check out the _Hope for Health_ bar serving &quot;inner cleanse ale&quot; as indicated by the oddly smelling puddles in the parking lot. &nbsp;The _Hope for Health_bar, so named for an asian pun, caters to a clientelle who have so many medical problems, they come here to hope for health. &nbsp;A whopping 4.5 pukes!

At least one wild cougar has been terrorizing Downtown Honolulu: The reports indicate that the cougars nab man-cubs with their wild ways, grab them kitten fashion up twenty story buildings. &nbsp;These 20 to 25 year old man-cubs stand no chance of avoiding the charms of these Yakuza of Grrl power, {{{First Name}}}. Over time, these men find their groove, are released back into the wild months to years later bewildered at how the time has passed. &nbsp;They sometimes write  [great music][0] . &nbsp;

Down in San Francisco, the dental blues are keeping whole neighborhoods awake with the pained screams of the victims. &nbsp;Teeth are not just a convienience for chewing food, they have rich blood supplies that go straight to your brain. &nbsp;Very bad Juju. Keep your body healthy, {{{First Name}}}: it is your gateway to reality. &nbsp;Diminish your body, and you greatly diminish your ability to relate to reality. Choose wisely. &nbsp;I wonder what  [Cthulu's denta][1] l needs were.

On the subject of bacterial infections, St. John's is officially [Amoeba][2] Free!

The city council has told me they want me to push St. John's as the &quot;amoeba free district.&quot; &nbsp;The facts about amoeba density in St. Johns needs to be brought out: amoebas are just not tolerated in St. John's. &nbsp;Bambi, of the city council went on: &nbsp;&quot;Published statistics about amoeba density in St. John's are vastly skewed to prevent true knowledge of the facts&quot;

OK, so we don't allow amoebas here. &nbsp;No shop is required to accept money from one of these low-lifes! Bambi explains: &quot;A  [Nice Fox][3] , maybe, That don't mean anything at all. &nbsp;Raccoons neither.&quot;

Sandy told me about the big hairy spiders. &nbsp;The _big_ones. &nbsp;Sandy woke up this morning at the corner of [Chicago and Dumpster][4]&nbsp; and said he saw one. &nbsp;High up in a tree. &nbsp;As the sun came up it went away -- back across the bridge, Sandy says.  Southwick says I should trust him, He is a county champion of Tommy, OR. He won the Delirium Tremens three years in a row... &nbsp;It's a special thing for public transportation. &nbsp;Maybe Tri-Met gives you a badge and everything.

Sandy says: &quot;Bear-Spinners cross over the St. John's Bridge every fall. &nbsp;I seen 'um. &nbsp;I heard stories from old-timers for years, but now, I seen 'em!&quot;

It seems these Bear-spinners can snatch a baby off the back of a Harley Davidson on a mountain road. Now, these evil things are trying to gain a foothold in the 140' evergreens of Pier Park. &nbsp;So far, they have been held back by the neighborhood search and siezure parade on October 31st. &nbsp;Kids scare 'em somehow.
