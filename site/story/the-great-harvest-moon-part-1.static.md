<p>&nbsp;The Great Harvest moon is over, it's Tuesday morning and I'm safe, for now, at the James John Cafe.</p>

<p >Where do I begin?&nbsp; with Southwick's saga from 3 Gunas Loop?&nbsp; With the extra hugs and kisses from unexpected ladies?&nbsp; With the very odd requests for Tarot readings?</p>

<p >Let's just start a week or so ago:&nbsp; I get a request from a totally deaf young lady for a Tarot reading.&nbsp; We share my 'puter and type out the reading.&nbsp; It kind of works, because we have a written transcript.&nbsp; She lit up when the King of Pentacles appeared in her future.&nbsp; Doesn't take a fortune teller to figure <i>that</i> out, but I receive credit for the miracle with a grateful hug. &nbsp;Reward the messenger? &nbsp;That's what fortune tellers do best.</p>

<p >More buzz last week in St. John's revolved around a possible suicide off the St. John's Bridge.&nbsp; Our Beloved Bridge just got out of the Oregon Penitentiary a few years ago for assisting too many suicides.&nbsp; He had a gun and everything and was threatening babies with crystal morphine.&nbsp; At least that's what the street buzz was all about.</p>

<p >A street waif came up to me on Thursday evening, hugs me and says &quot;I don't want to NOT love you:&nbsp; I need to go now&quot; -- I saw her again on Monday, she smiled, talked amiably, and the odd glint in her eye was gone.&nbsp; Maybe I'm a father figure.&nbsp; Maybe I looked like her fix kit.&nbsp; The moon was full.&nbsp; I told her that I'm not the Celarien, I just play one in real life.</p>

<p >I walked through Slim's late, late on Friday.&nbsp; A very young and beautiful lady was leading around a guy built like a fullback.&nbsp; She asked about my hat and such.&nbsp; As soon as I said the word Tarot, she was all into a reading:&nbsp; She suspended her fullback in her gaze and floated us over to a waiting booth.&nbsp; Ordering the Tarot Reader his required shot of rum she shows all the signs of a Female-Lion tamer.&nbsp; Yes, you guessed it: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bardagency.com/store/tarot_11_strength_detail.html">Tarot Card VIII, Strength</a>.&nbsp; The girl power card.&nbsp; Amped up on Great Harvest Steroids.</p>

<p >We do the reading.&nbsp; When the knight of swords comes up, and I ask her if that might be the hulk who she wore like a feather boa.&nbsp; She flashes 'no, no, no' in invisible sign language and we proceed.&nbsp; After the reading, (and during, and before) she is huggy and affectionate.&nbsp; Having had a bit of experience with women of Great Strength, I figure the Fullback, with his taste for spicy burgers,&nbsp; will be in for a rough life.&nbsp; Adios, Mr Lion and your future with Strength.</p>

<p >It all reminds me of dwarf Grumpy's advice: &quot;Careful, She's got Womanly Wiles!&quot; [First Name], I hear you ask, &quot;What are they?&quot; &nbsp;Grumpy is quick to answer: &quot;I don't know, but I'm <i><b>agin</b></i><b> 'em</b>&quot; ---Relax Grumpy, Life is far sweeter with that particular cup, just make sure you follow the house rules and always tip the bartender.</p>

<p >I wander home singing: &quot;It's Strengths illusions I recall, I really don't know Strength at all.&quot;&nbsp; I go back home and pass by the house on 3 Gunas Loop.&nbsp; All three of the wise men there seem to be howling at the moon.</p>

<p >[First Name], meet me again at the James John Cafe, here at a secret location near the Willamette River and&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll let you know what I found out. &nbsp;There's more. &nbsp;Much more.</p>
