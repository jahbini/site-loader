 Hi, {{{First Name}}},&nbsp;I had asked Southwick to send out yesterday's story, I hope it got through to you: it had the wrong return address.&nbsp; Xin Loi Bah.&nbsp; I had to go across town to the Dental School:&nbsp; I get to help a student learn his craft.&nbsp; My tooth might get a diamond inlay.&nbsp; More likely my tooth gets a root canal.

[Dentists][0] have the goal of giving you a functional set of teeth -- [Dentation][1].&nbsp; They have a maximum standard: Can the patient chew?&nbsp; End of treatment.&nbsp; Done deal.&nbsp; Anything extra is way outside of standard treatment: including cyanide or diamond inlays for spies and gangstas. &nbsp;[Cosmetic dentistry][2], not basic research, is where the money is.

&nbsp;

But that essentially means that the Dental Profession is stuck.&nbsp; They do not have to improve.&nbsp; They get their job done.&nbsp; And that's the Portland attitude: Git 'er done.&nbsp; A dentist will learn to glad hand the patient, drill 'em, fill 'em, and bill 'em to give 'em the thrill'em.&nbsp; That is the craft, and a Dentist from 1920 would have no difficulty in the modern dentists office.&nbsp; I have asked dentists repeatedly about that fact, and they agree, that in large measure, the field is stagnant.&nbsp; Dental research may exist, but... &nbsp; why?

&nbsp;

The appointment took three hours, and my tooth is awaiting final judgement on root-canal or crown or diamond inlay.&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that I can have salad dressing without having crazy twitches for hours afterward. &nbsp;The aerial tram ride back was fabulous with Mount Hood in the distance, but the trains ran late, and I missed my usual appointment to gather stories at the [Open Range Street Person Preserve][3]in St John's.

So, {{{First Name}}}, I stopped by 3 Gunas Lp to share a beer with Southwick and Tommy: Roger was still out at his lady's house on the coast. &nbsp;

Southwick mentions physics, Tommy says he knows all about it:&nbsp;

&quot;It's hydrogen. Think of the electron as the woman who plays hard to get.&nbsp; The man in the center is stuck.&nbsp; That's hydrogen, Southwick!&nbsp; That's Hydrogen.&nbsp; You know hydrogen! &nbsp; Well, that's how it works!&nbsp;

Tommy's voice explodes each phrase as if the force of his words makes it a matter of personal experience.

&quot;And when you got two or more protons you need newtrons. &nbsp;You need some easy women in there or else they are faggots.&nbsp; Just think of the orgy that Uranium has got going in the new Klus thing. &nbsp;And I got the hot tub in the center.&quot;

Southwick barely registers shock, and shoots back: &quot;That's nucleus, Tommy, but even though you are a card carrying member of the &quot;Church of Who Gives a Fuck,&quot; (which lets you use the word 'faggot' to mean something else than a bundle of sticks.) pointing out women to be 'easy' or 'hard to get' makes a good analogy for nuclear physics is stretching a bit don't you think? &nbsp;The women you know are the women _**you**_ consider whores. &nbsp; To me, they are something quite else, and I don't get any sexual images from the nucleus:&nbsp; Or I didn't up to _now_ , thank you very much!&quot;

But Tommy wasn't paying much attention, he had gone back to tearing the wings off of old Ferrari's.&nbsp;

Hi, This is Al.&nbsp; Southwick, ha, he walked right into that one.&nbsp; He's going to be looking for electrons now!

&nbsp;

{{{First Name}}}, I work at the docks.&nbsp; I read St John's Jims emails every day.&nbsp; Just to proove that you don't need to be no literaty types to have a laff at Southwick.&nbsp; Tommy tells me where to laugh, sometimes. &nbsp; He's usually wrong, but we laugh where he says anyways.&nbsp; So tell your friends to subscribe.&nbsp; Ya don't want your sewer to back up, do ya?

(queue Jim)

Jim here again: Thanks, Al for your uninformed endorsement, I'm sure the readers will appreciate it.

Bye for today, I'll leave you with this thought from The Tarot of the Celarien:

The King of Swords might advise: &quot;To be King, know your true adversary.&quot;
