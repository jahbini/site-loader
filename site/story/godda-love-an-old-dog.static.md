<p>&nbsp;I'm walking into town, it's cold and I'm thinking the crema on James John Cafe espresso is thicker than the blankets in Honolulu.&nbsp; Maybe some St. John's blankets, too.</p>
<p >I wrap up my left-brain into my back-pack about 10AM.&nbsp; Tech stuff done for the day.&nbsp; My right-brain says it wants to go for a walk, huh, huh, please??&nbsp; I make a deal with the right brain: make sure we have something to write by the time we get to our secret cafe. &nbsp;You come up with the idea, and I'll put it in words.</p>

<p >So I'm walking: right brain happy to be outside and marking all the telephone poles and fire hydrants. Ideas for writing? &nbsp;Nothing.&nbsp; Something.&nbsp; &quot;I went to India?&quot; Nope.&nbsp; &quot;India went to Jim?&quot;&nbsp; Possible.&nbsp; Might work.&nbsp; Actually happened, too...</p>

<p >But nothing solid.&nbsp; Lots of thoughts: &quot;put the Tarot writing on-line&quot; ...&quot;<em>look at that scruffy dog, seems sick</em>&quot; ... &quot;put up a web-forum for you, [First Name], to leave comments&quot; ... &quot;Did you remember to lock the door?&quot; <strong>Lock the Door?!?</strong></p>

<p >Ouch.&nbsp; I forgot to remember if I did.&nbsp; <em>Cant forget what you forgot till you forget it.</em>&nbsp; So I walk back to check the door.&nbsp; Still no great ideas.&nbsp; Looks like this will be a late edition, and that will cut into story book hour over at Slim's -- That's a no-no: the old dogs there have well earned stories.</p>

<p >One of them, Ulysses has unkempt whiskers poping out of his stocking cap like some fungal puff-ball.&nbsp; His line is ridiculously monotonous: he always asks for money, and instantly follows up by saying &quot;I haven't had a drink in 10 years&quot; -- I think: &quot;I don't give a crap what you do when you have money, <em>do you have a good story</em>?&quot; -- Joan of Arc walks up and says &quot;Jim, he's scamming you.&quot;&nbsp; Thanks, Justice, but his story will be bought cheaply, I assure you. Mwa - Ha - Ha...</p>

<p >Finally I'm headed out.&nbsp; Late.&nbsp; What to write about?&nbsp; Not a good idea in the batch.<em>&nbsp; Crap, There's that scruffy dog again.&nbsp; Looks lame, starving... &nbsp;[First Name], Should I call the pound?</em>&nbsp; I see a guy idling his time nearby.&nbsp; Doesn't he feed his dog?&nbsp; Is he a street-dweller?</p>

<p >&quot;Hi! Is that your dog? He looks like he needs some help.&quot; &nbsp; --- &quot;Yes. ... He's winding down&quot; the guy says slowly and sadly.&nbsp; I realize the dog is not ill-treated, but an important part of this guys life.</p>

<p >I shout: &quot;Godda love an Old Dog&quot; -- He shouts back: &quot;Thanks&quot; as he leads his cherubim companion slowly back home.&nbsp; He knows the inevitable -- It takes love. &nbsp;Right brain uncorks a bottle of compassion, responsibility and pathos and serves it up in my cup of life.</p>

<p >And Ulysses' story.&nbsp; It will be bought cheaply: a few dollars, some honest interest in him as a human being, and a feeling that he is heard will be the price. &nbsp;It isn't expensive, just precious. &nbsp;Godda Love an Old Dog.</p>

<p >All us Old Dogs need it. &nbsp;I thank my Right brain for paying attention to this and my Left brain for putting it into words, both are well loved Old Dogs to me. (High Five, right brain, I knew you could do it!)</p>

<p >And yes, in a sense, India DID go to Jim.&nbsp; I'll tell you about that, too.</p>
