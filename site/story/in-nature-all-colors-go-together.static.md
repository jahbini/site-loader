<p>Color.&nbsp; I see color.&nbsp; The Oregon rain has washed away the city from the green.&nbsp; Actually gold, red, unguent orchid poop too.&nbsp; All these shades in all combinations.&nbsp; <em>In nature all colors go together well</em>.</p>
<p >As I&rsquo;m walking in the rain seeing the moss on the fences vibrant and alive where just a few days ago was Grey City gray.&nbsp; I see preparations for halloween.&nbsp; Pumpkin heads lining the patios and walkways.&nbsp; Trick or treat time.&nbsp; The annual parade that keeps the giant spiders away from Pier Park.</p>

<p >The preparations have been underway for weeks, and some of the houses have elaborate displays of hand carved pumpkins.</p>

<p >A very gothic street waif bundled in fur hands me a flier, I continue walking, It has a shock headline:</p>

<p >&ldquo;Take THAT you f*cking Pumpkin!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll cut your goddam EYES out!&rdquo;</p>
<p >&mdash; How we torture our vegetables. &nbsp; Sad.&nbsp; Grow up Amerika! Stop pumpkin torture!</p>

<p >An Anti-vegetable anti-torture society.&nbsp; Here in Portland.&nbsp; Wearing fur.&nbsp; Imagine that, [First Name].&nbsp; We all have our causes, I guess.</p>

<p >I see Hookers and johns (St. John&rsquo;s johns?), Angels too.</p>

<p >I see a street hooker swooped up by an Earth Angel who takes the hooker to her ample bosom and suckles her as if she was an infant.</p>

<p >I see a sweaty, dirty man eyeing them both, waiting turn as soon as the Angel leaves.</p>

<p >The hooker?&nbsp; They call her Throntle, after Throntle-Dontle the Germanic Tooth Farie &mdash; She&rsquo;s Norse.&nbsp; Heavy tooth lady.&nbsp; Big teeth.&nbsp; Healthy.&nbsp; Ugly Betty to the max. Did I mention her teeth were prominent? <em><span >(don&rsquo;t stare!)</span></em></p>

<p >No, Throntle isn&rsquo;t Norse, she&rsquo;s dishwater DNA like me or you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s her teeth. Magnificent but few in number. <span ><em>([First Name], I told you not to stare!)</em></span>&nbsp; She&rsquo;s raised kids, they own castles in spain.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s done everything for everybody and given them everything and they still take, take, take all I got!&nbsp; Well I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; out for number one now, buddy, and I don&rsquo;t trust you, I don&rsquo;t trust ANYBODY.</p>

<p >Yes, she&rsquo;s that kind of heroin powered hooker.&nbsp; Looking for a fix and a place to sleep.&nbsp; Preferably a place with some things she might borrow to keep her alive.&nbsp; She has to look out for number one, now, [First Name].</p>

<p >The john?&nbsp; Does it matter?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s just the male equivalent of Throntle.&nbsp; Got nothing, wants money, needs everything but exchanges it for the moment.&nbsp; As if there were no other moments.</p>

<p >The Earth Angel?&nbsp; Earth Angels know lots of paths. &nbsp; She may even have walked the streets herself.&nbsp; She has walked with many hookers and knows their emotional paths like she knows the path to the refrigerator.&nbsp; She has the emotional Aikido to gently help Throntle look passed the end of her nose.&nbsp; Still, the Earth Angels can only hand Throntle the windex, saying &ldquo;you must clean your own vision.&rdquo;</p>
