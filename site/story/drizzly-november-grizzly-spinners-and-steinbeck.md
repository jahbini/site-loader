Monday.&nbsp; November.&nbsp; Pacific NorthWest Patented All Day Twilight. &nbsp;Perfect for portrait photography.&nbsp; Soft everywhere. Up, Down, Sideways &mdash; Soft light.&nbsp; Lots of bare branches in the trees.&nbsp; Mama is getting ready for bed.&nbsp; She is rolling down her oak-leaf [L&rsquo;Eggs][0], showering the summer away, tucking in the nuts and seeds in secret hiding places, and turning down the lamp.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll hang out the **Do Not Disturb** sign and bed herself down.&nbsp; Mama NorthWest likes her sex when she awakens, you know:&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;s a productivity Empress that has no peer.

The light is so soft that the spider webs are totally invisible in the rain:&nbsp; Exactly as planned by the

SpiderFest 2010 clean-up committee.&nbsp; All part of Mama&rsquo;s productions, you know.

One of the Munsters wrote me: &ldquo;Hi, I love your stories.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a professional vegetable torturer, and what I can do to frozen french fries would curl your toes.&nbsp; I think St. Paul sux.&nbsp; I mean, as saints go, he was a douche.&nbsp; But a holy douche.&rdquo;

Yes, Ed, I&rsquo;m glad that we live in St. John&rsquo;s, and not St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want my kids to marry an apostle, No offense meant to any of the apostles, but it&rsquo;s that vow of poverty thing, you know. &nbsp; Along with the chastity thing.&nbsp; And my heart goes out to all those deep-fried french fries.

Oh, yes, Monday.&nbsp; The James John Cafe is closed.&nbsp; In fact, they will be closed all week: Celebrations and holidays for Suzanne&rsquo;s crew.&nbsp; It seems that there have been secret trade negotiations among the staff, and a merger is happening: Justin and Danny are Mr and Mrs Justin and Danny. &nbsp;Or Mr and Mrs Danny and Justin. &nbsp;Names are confusing.

I wonder how will this affect the quality of the Espresso &mdash; Danny's _steam-punk love_ scalds the coffee: the howl of the steam cries &ldquo;crema&rdquo;, and the thick tears flow.&nbsp; She watches intently, contemplating the wonders of their future, ignoring&nbsp;the horrors those poor coffee beans suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;{{{First Name}}}, wish them well, and hope for their health. &nbsp;I do.

And that reminds me about the &ldquo;Hope for Health&rdquo; bar and dumpster, where I was able to talk with Sandy about the Bear Spinner attack last night: Halloween.

I find Sandy kind of curled up in a doorway. &nbsp;He has some whitish goo on his hands and pants. &nbsp;I don't shake his hand, and he says something about it being spider silk from the big battle.

Sandy tells me: &ldquo;yeah, last night.&nbsp; Bad night. ugh.&nbsp; She got &lsquo;em though.&nbsp; Big Amazon Woman Cat thing.&nbsp; About 10PM, I began to see &lsquo;em again.&nbsp; High up in the trees.&nbsp; Spiders all over the dumpster.&nbsp; Brushing all over my face.&nbsp; Not crows&hellip; Kinda. &nbsp;Maybe.&rdquo;

Sandy heard something over on the St. John's bridge. &nbsp;The whole bridge was covered in them! &nbsp;Sandy said: &quot;Big ones, and even bigger ones. &nbsp;Hairy. &nbsp;big hairy spiders. and then the scream!&quot;

The scream was the challenge of a Big Cat.&nbsp; All of the spiders stopped dead for a moment.&nbsp; Then this crazy cougar jumped off the back of a Harley right &nbsp;the thick of it. &nbsp;Battling with claws, fangs and stiletto heels and kisses, the cougar was in top form. &nbsp;She **_was_** a skin tight leotard with a dragon ripping its way out.

Suddenly everything was silent and huge Bear Spinner appeared. &nbsp;The king or queen.&nbsp; Must have been 8 foot from butt to beak.&nbsp; Even bigger legs.&nbsp; The Cougar leaped, the boss leaped. &nbsp; They twirled, they grappled, they stroked, they bit.

But as the Cougar did her stuff, the boss spider having a tough time figuring if he was fighting or having a good time.&nbsp; The Boss screamed in ecstasy and shot spider silk in every direction.&nbsp; All the other spiders began fighting amongst themselves, and when the boss smiled it&rsquo;s last smile, said: &ldquo;hold me,&rdquo; the cougar simply pushed the boss off the middle of the bridge. &nbsp;It shares the bottom of the Willamette with Bamboo Willy.

All the spiders parted and began gyrating in anticipation.&nbsp; The cougar strutted over the bridge. They followed.

I looked at the St. John&rsquo;s bridge, and the spider silk is all washed away: it must have looked impressive.&nbsp; But then, It could be just the wet dream of an old [alky:&nbsp; Sandy also tells me he has won the Oregon Tilth Certified Organic Delirium Tremens][2] for five consecutive years. &nbsp;I wonder if that stuff on Sandy's pants might really be spider silk?

But then I remembered Sandy mentioned a Harley.&nbsp; On a hunch I called Roger over at 3 Gunas Lp.

Roger admitted to taking her to the bridge at midnight.&nbsp; I asked Roger: &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t Cougars supposed to like younger guys?&nbsp; You are pushing 70!&rdquo;

Roger says: &ldquo;A Cougar like that can like anybody she wants to.&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;m an expert at Preventative Maintanence.&nbsp; Ladies like a feeling of safety and security.&nbsp; Even Cougars.&nbsp; Ya think?&rdquo;

Yup, {{{First Name}}}, shall we agree safety and security are pretty desirable in a relationship?

My hat&rsquo;s off to you Roger.

The spiders?&nbsp; The Cougar?

Rumor is that they live high in the trees over at Forest Park.&nbsp; Who knows what horrors will come out of a deep forest spider-cougar commune next year?&nbsp; Southwick, what have you done?

The reality? &nbsp;Well, I'm with [Steinbeck][3]. I love all my character's views of reality. &nbsp;The Celarien tells me that they are all 100% correct.
