OK.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s start giving thanks.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been doing it all day. &nbsp; I'm thankful the James John Cafe has the most fabulous food, and that Slim's has such great fung shui.

_**Lissen up**_ -- This is Tommy from Gunas Lp. &nbsp;As head of ethics here at Waterfront U, I want to remind you guys to be thankful for the&nbsp;good deal we got. &nbsp;guaranteed employment.

You guys got all the sludge cleaned up from the Willamette, and we get the water tested next week. &nbsp;We get paid for the contract to clean up the river. &nbsp;Be thankful.

So&nbsp;You guys each take a barrel of toxic stuff home wit you. &nbsp;Then after the test, you guys wanna pour that sludge back into youse toilets. &nbsp;That means we get to clean up the river next year too. &nbsp;Be thankful.

Uh, thanks, Tommy, I guess I'm thankful that your ethics are not any lower. &nbsp;Let's start with the basics of thanksgiving.

Life.&nbsp; Health. Food.&nbsp; Family. The Feeling that even if you don&rsquo;t know what the future is, you have connections with good people to cheer you through the hard times. As they say on the internet, YMMV -- your mileage may vary: your mix of blessings is unique to you.

Southwick says he is thankful that Love Honey has &quot;Half Price Luxury Vibes&quot; for Black Friday! &nbsp;He also tells me not to forget the bridge. &nbsp;(_Jim, don't forget the [bridge][0]_!)

_**And oh, yes, the bridge.**_

It has been the Joy of St. John&rsquo;s for nearly eighty years.&nbsp; Even Wayne, our hallowed 85 year old barber, does not remember a time when the bridge was not the beacon of beauty and pride.

Thanks for the bridge,&nbsp;for the joy, for the beauty, thanks for the hope.&nbsp; Those qualities have value.

Bambi from the City Council starts shaking his antlers wildly: &quot;_Value_?&nbsp; Did someone say VALUE?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t we think of this before! &nbsp;We need to get hope out of our eyes and into our pockets!

Bambi says &quot;We need to dismantle the Bridge!!&quot;

Bambi is not advocating any useless or spectacular destruction, rather we should take it apart piece by piece and sell it to the highest bidder.&nbsp; Maybe it will be used to span an open pit mine in China, or be picked up by North Korea and renamed the &ldquo;Bridge to Kim Jong Il&rsquo;s Ego&rdquo; or possibly sold to the Middle Eastern Museum of Infidel Artifacts. These guys have MONEY, and[J. G. Wentworth][1] isn&rsquo;t answering St. John&rsquo;s calls.

Besides, taking apart the bridge will employ hundreds of workers for many months.&nbsp; The hookers of St. John&rsquo;s will rejoice. &nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Get back to me.

Or&hellip;. maybe you don&rsquo;t want to dismantle the St. John&rsquo;s bridge.&nbsp; You like it where it is?&nbsp; Then be thankful...&nbsp; Thanksgiving, remember?

Because tomorrow, the &ldquo;Seasonal Decorations&rdquo; go up and I shudder to think of the bridge covered in Wal-Mart wreaths and bubble blowing plastic Santas.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thankful that it looks fine just the way it is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t muck with it, City Council &mdash; This means you, Bambi!
