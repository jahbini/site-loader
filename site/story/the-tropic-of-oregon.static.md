<p>Hi, [First Name] Good news: the hurricane of women over at 3 Gunas Lp may be over.&nbsp; That's what Southwick mentioned to me this morning at the James John Cafe.&nbsp; Seems that Tommy gave one of the ladies a ride on his motorcycle.&nbsp; She burned her ankle on the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; Tommy was very upset: her skin left an imprint on the chrome and he wants her to pay for the re-plating.</p>
<p >- One of my readers is an ex Shock Jock from Southern California.&nbsp; He sings &quot;Paint it Black&quot; on Girl Scout road trips.&nbsp; He favorably compared my writing to toilet paper: You can start on any sheet you want.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; Ahhhh, [First Name], I'm a sucker for compliments.</p>

<p >- I sometimes miss Honolulu. (As Roger from Gunas Lp might say: &quot;Ya think?&quot;)&nbsp; The weather, acceptance and aloha of the Islands are still vivid in my mind.&nbsp; You can imagine my surprise when I found there is club that has a chain of resorts called the Tropic of Oregon.</p>

<p >Membership is very selective and it involves a yearly check up by a proctologist to make sure you're not an asshole.&nbsp; Once inside, the weather changes remarkably, warm and inviting -- balmy scents in the air.&nbsp; Lots and lots of aloha shirts.&nbsp; The members are very giving of their time, energy and expertise.&nbsp; A very industrious bunch dedicating their lives to increase their animal magnetism using the fabled chinese medicine, green elephant horn.&nbsp; This elephant has been decimated in it's natural habitat with laws passed against owning, poaching, use or transportation. &nbsp; Still, zoos in the tropics are granted special dispensation, and so, the 'Tropic of Oregon' society was created to satisfy the legalities of owning, raising and using at protected zoo-resorts.&nbsp; The Tropic of Oregon is dedicated to preserving, breeding, training, and all uses of the Green Elephant.</p>

<p >I spoke with the local representative, Ho Tai, while sipping kambucha and worm-tea (note to self: read the label next time).&nbsp; He shared secrets of the occident coupled with tropical wisdom that has been suppressed for decades.&nbsp; It seems that at one time elephants were legal and roamed freely in the US until the Great Depression; the beef market was nearing collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Viciously suppressed by congress in the intervening decades, the green elephant, once on the verge of extinction, is making a comeback. &nbsp;Tropic societies are forming in several states to assist this transformation.&nbsp; Ho Tai says &quot;The benefits of proper management of Green Elephant horn stagger the imagination but will benefit the nation. Like sex, the Green Elephant is here to stay.&quot;</p>

<p >- Spiders: &nbsp;Autumn in Portland is filled with harvest festival activity:&nbsp; SpiderFest 2010 is running through the end of the month.&nbsp; Bamboo Willy is currently the &quot;catch-em-wrap-em&quot; champ.&nbsp; You can see him in his (her?) massive web in the bamboo patch at the corner of <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=114144299215869109392.0004920b87d0a9c46bbd7">Smith and Chicago</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p >The spiders are making for very interesting research.&nbsp; I'm finding that the aerial mammals that spin webs are the Arachno Dillo and the Arachno Ursus.&nbsp; This is courting season, and they abandon their reclusive ways for only a few weeks in October. I'll keep you posted.</p>
