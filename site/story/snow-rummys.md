One of my best dumpster diving correspondents on the street has gone missing.&nbsp; No one has seen Ulysses for about a month, and I am wondering if he is one of those fabled &ldquo;Snow Rummys,&rdquo;&nbsp; You know, bums who can go south for the winter and north for the summer. &nbsp; He was pretty active, and always had his hand out, along with the same well recited lines.

Southwick did find this out on the Internet:

Join us for a free Webinar to introduce the magic of

Power Begging and the 4 Hour Begging Week System

Hi, this is Ulysses,&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been on the streets for 15 years.&nbsp; Homeless.&nbsp; Inner city.&nbsp; This is the life style that takes you down quick.&nbsp; Begging, rejection, religion, all bad news.&nbsp; Few can make it as long as two years.&nbsp; But I figured out a way to survive on the streets that don&rsquo;t take you down. &nbsp;All without compromising your lifestyle - alcohol? no problem.&nbsp; drugs? no problem. &nbsp;No attention span? Perfect.

It&rsquo;s called Power Begging: Jedi tricks that make the poop on your jeans your best asset!

Power Begging enables the 4 Hour Begging Week

Here is what [Vinnie][0] said after I taught him Power Begging:&nbsp; &ldquo;I kiss the gutter each night and thank you Ulysses for your mostly guaranteed income tricks that keep me down and out &mdash; All in only 4 hours of begging a week.&nbsp; Thank You for your life altering &ldquo;Power Begging&rdquo; techniques and your mind-blowing 4 hour Begging Week.

The 4 hour Begging Week is so simple that this guy can do it.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s hardly ever illegal.&nbsp; You can be homeless where ever you want.&nbsp; Inner City in the Summer?&nbsp; Arizona Desert in the Winter?

What's the biggest problem with begging? &nbsp;It's boring, humiliating, full of rejection and tedious to remember what story you told last time.

But with the 4 Hour Begging Week, we lay it out for you in terms a wino can understand, and you can live on the street like the bum you really are!

_**Take your street skills to the next level.**_

Amazing! you can do this with only 4 hours of real begging_each week!_ &nbsp;I have figured ways for you to bargain for pocket cash, overnight stays, yes, even hookers, all without real consequences on your part.&nbsp; Practical things, too, even laundry tips like how to push your shopping carts through the car wash to get all your laundry done at once.

_**And that&rsquo;s not all.**_

I will show you, step by step, with videos that you can see on-line at your public library.&nbsp; You will be amazed at how efficient my &ldquo;4 hour Begging Week&rdquo; system is, and how a street bum loaded on crank could do it.

**_Don&rsquo;t buy Yet!_**

{{{First Name}}}, If _you_&nbsp;look online you will come up with nothing, of course. &nbsp;For Ulysses, &nbsp;sleeping with the mermaids of the Willamette is as likely as where &quot;there's a lake of stew and whiskey too, at the big rock candy mountain.&quot; -- Although, if he comes back in April and wants to sell me his franchise, I just might buy it!

Tarot Note: &nbsp;The reading today came from the randomly drawn destination &quot;Strength&quot; with the motif cards:&nbsp;2 of Wands (getting the word out) and the seven of swords (the trickster). &nbsp; &nbsp;Honest.
