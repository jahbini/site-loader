I just got to the James John Cafe.&nbsp; I took out my 'puter for a writing session, sat down.&nbsp; I looked up to find someone in a bear costume with a blue t-shirt that says: &quot;Dental Ben.&quot;&nbsp; Ben is dancing to entertain kids.&nbsp; There are no kids.&nbsp; Ben can't see out of the tiny holes in his bear mask and dances anyway.&nbsp; Dancing Bears are not allowed in St. John's.&nbsp; Joe Rilla, the bouncer, tells Ben: &quot;Our speakeasy license won't allow for dancing, come back when you can keep yourself under control.&quot;&nbsp; And then throws Ben into the street in the pouring rain.

The sun comes out and Ben is totally dry before he hits the pavement.&nbsp; Oregon weather is changeable.&nbsp; The News Weathermen walk around town with rain gauges, stop every 10 feet and ask: &quot;Is it raining yet?&quot;&nbsp; Yes, rain and cold. &nbsp;Lots of both.

It's phlegm season in Oregon. &nbsp;Another thing in great abundance in the PNW.&nbsp; (Yes, I'll be reporting from Flemm Fest 2010, too:&nbsp; The Loogies will be playing.&nbsp; It used to be &quot;Tobacco Wad and The Loogies,&quot; Tobacco Wad's career went down in smoke in the [Cancer Scare][0] of the late 1900's. &nbsp;This century, we will be told that Cancer is a good thing.)

So the forecast is for phlegm with occasional cement in the joints, until next April.&nbsp; Only the [Tropic of Oregon][1] is immune, somehow.&nbsp; I think it's the worm tea, but don't quote me on that.

As I passed Bamboo Willy's place this morning, I noticed his (her?) [giant web][2] had been washed away by the rain.&nbsp; A sad loss for our favorite in the &quot;catch-em-wrap-em&quot; event of SpiderFest 2010.&nbsp; The [Willow twins][3] on N St. John's Ave are currently in the lead.

I'm not the only one who pays attention to spiders.&nbsp; We got people who pay attention to them.&nbsp; Important people.&nbsp; People like Tommy over at Gunas Lp.&nbsp; He is concerned that the Mountain Spiders will come down and play catch-em-wrap-em with his Ski-Doos and ATV's.&nbsp; He says the big boats and the Corvette are too heavy for the spiders to lift, and he isn't worried about them. &nbsp; Southwick tried to tell Tommy that spiders only want living flesh, but Tommy wasn't convinced: &quot;Basically, we are talking a whole different spider.&nbsp; And stop talking that Latin shit: 'Arachno Ursus;' Nobody's gonna know what you're talkin about.&nbsp; Mom called 'em Grizzly Spinners, you know, Bear Spiders, the big ones.&nbsp; They come out of the trees and work in teams.&quot;&nbsp; Tommy pays attention to the spiders, too.

There are other people who pay attention to nature:&nbsp; Norman.&nbsp; Norman watches squirrels.&nbsp; He knows their lives, their likes, dislikes.&nbsp; He knows that for proper aroma a seed has to be licked three times before it is buried.&nbsp; He watches the blue-jays and the squirrels battle in the &quot;hide the acorn&quot; war.&nbsp; The Jays rule the daytime with their aerial attacks, and the squirrels have midnight raids on the Jay's strongholds.&nbsp; Norman sides with the squirrels.&nbsp; Norman is safe, the jays don't know where he lives.&nbsp; {{{First Name}}}, I would not want the jays to know where I live.

{{{First Name}}}, thanks for helping with my writing experiment:&nbsp; e-mail stories.&nbsp; E-mail has some opportunities for expression that few writers have explored.&nbsp; I get to do that from my table at the James John Cafe.&nbsp; One thing, is that I can ask what you works, and what doesn't.&nbsp; Are these too short?&nbsp; Too long? I'd like to get more explicit with Tommy's rants, but beware, he really does say some wild things.

So, {{{First Name}}} -- do you want to just reply with your feedback?&nbsp; Or would you be more at ease with a web forum?&nbsp; Let me know.

Ciao for Now -- St. John's Jim
