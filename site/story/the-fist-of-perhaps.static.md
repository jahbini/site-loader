<p >People sometimes use phrases that I can't figure out. Is it slang? Is&nbsp;it English? Something Gov. Paris Palin said? There are lots of&nbsp;subcultures that I miss out on. I heard the headline phrase come out&nbsp;of the Muse's mouth not too long ago. Whassit mean? &quot;The Fist of&nbsp;Perhaps&quot; ---&nbsp;</p>

<p >My long distance readers, the Ten Foot Teen and the Mamacita de Luz,&nbsp;want a Tarot Reading, by e-mail. OK. Let&rsquo;s try this.</p>

<p >If you are local to Portland, though, a face to face reading is best.</p>

<p >-Choose a &lsquo;question&rsquo; &mdash; what that might be is up to you.</p>

<p >If you share your question with me (and you phrase it so I can&nbsp;understand it: Friend, I'm talking to you -- none of this &quot;fist&nbsp;of perhaps&quot; stuff) I can help with the interpretation better.</p>

<p >-Get a Ryder-waide-smith (the classic) deck. Other's are OK if they&nbsp;have the standard cards.</p>

<p >-sleep with it overnight, unless otherwise instructed.</p>

<p >-shuffle deck as much as you want, Lots is good. Meditate on &quot;der&nbsp;question.&quot; Ask yourself questions about the question: &quot;Will it be good&nbsp;for me?&quot; &quot;Will it be good for my family&quot; to &quot;Who Gives a Fuck?&quot;</p>

<p >-Pick ten at random and e-mail me the names of the cards, including&nbsp;&lsquo;inversion&rsquo; if you want.</p>

<p >Personally, I feel that the &lsquo;inversion&rsquo; of the archetype occurs in&nbsp;real-life not in the cards, and you, Friend, need to do the&nbsp;homework portion of the reading both inverted AND right side up.</p>

<p >You should pick ONE card from the remaining cards that YOU most&nbsp;closely identify with -- in your opinion. That will be the 'persona'&nbsp;that I'll use for the interpretation.</p>

<p >I'll send you the interpretation. It is best if we do an exchange on&nbsp;each card, where you can ask questions, like a real reading. OR, just&nbsp;ask for the whole thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p >Here is my challenge to you: Use the &quot;fist of perhaps&quot; in a sentence.&nbsp;Try to make it mean something. Anything. -- I'll reply with the best&nbsp;answers here.</p>
