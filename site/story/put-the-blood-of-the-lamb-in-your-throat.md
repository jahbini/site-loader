&nbsp;I have held off ordering the Pork Chops, Grits and Eggs at the James John Cafe for about five or six days.&nbsp; Friends:&nbsp; This is the combination of tastes, aromas and textures that turns your mouth into a concert hall.&nbsp; I, St. John's Jim have so declared.

Today, I can wait no longer.&nbsp; Lust overcomes me and I know what I must have.&nbsp; The comfort food.&nbsp; Only grits and eggs has the power to energize the [aka cutting][0] I do. You know, tending the emotional garden:&nbsp; That's what Jim is all about: [Celarien][1].&nbsp; Your spirituality is harvested off of the fruits of your emotional garden.&nbsp; Tend it well.&nbsp; Lust is good -- drink it in small drops.

So I advise the raining wizard at the counter that I'm deadly serious to my commitment to great chops.&nbsp; He pales.&nbsp; He doesn't want me to unleash the [Lions Roar][2].

{{{First Name}}}, I have an unsolvable moral dilemma.

You see I have had the ex-california shock-jock reply to my last story with the phrase &quot;put the Blood of the Lamb in my Throat&quot; -- My visits to spirituality have been abundant, and I'm pretty familiar with the &quot;blood of the lamb&quot; part, but I'm puzzled by the &quot;Throat&quot; part.&nbsp; Clearly it has Biblical Proportions, and my mission on earth as Old Testament Prophet may be finally paying off.

Here is my problem:&nbsp; Is it a blessing or a curse?&nbsp; &quot;Watch out or I'll put the blood of the lamb in your throat&quot; or worse: &quot;I'll deep throat you with the Blood of the Lamb&quot;&nbsp;-- I'd add that to my &quot;Lion's Roar&quot; arsenal.

or is it :

Something I'd want on my TombStone: &quot;I put the Blood of the Lamb in the Throats of Billions&quot; -- (author's note: I just had my first bite of the chops -- Big Symphony .. Mmmmmmglglgllgl )

I called the local &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; translation service of the local &quot;Hookers-for-Christ&quot; service.&nbsp; They transferred me to [FireSignTheatre][3] 12:34: &quot;_And she knew not his hole from an ass in the ground._&quot;&nbsp; I require my hookers to speak in complete spiritual sentences, {{{First Name}}}.

{{{First Name}}}, I'm clueless: before I run out and have my new letter head designed, I need to know if it has the appropriate _creepy_ factor.&nbsp;

By the way: if you guys have a question for me or Southwick or Tommy, I'll try to have the reply in the next days story.&nbsp; (Jim: don't let your promises get you in trouble!)
