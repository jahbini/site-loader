I apologize for the uneven nature of yesterdays &quot;wrestling with memes&quot; -- There is a good story there someplace, but... &nbsp;I hope this, smaller piece is better.

St. John&rsquo;s is a festival of lights this season,&nbsp; non blinking white, against a centerpiece in each intersection that goes from red to green, then yellow and back to red again!&nbsp; Our St. John&rsquo;s imagination is rampant with sterility!&nbsp; (At this point, Kermit yells &ldquo;Yaaayyyy, Sterility!&rdquo;)

Last night the Puking Mule tavern had a celebration that included more tree-trimming and song at 2AM -- The caroake-carolers from the puking mule tavern came over and sang &ldquo;I trimmed it MYYYYY Way&rdquo;!

&nbsp;(Author's note: please do NOT mention that joke to anyone around the Puking Mule, I've heard that song enough and I don't want to give them ideas.)

A new business here in St. John's is Guru City &nbsp;specializing in channelling spirits on a seasonal basis.

Guru City and Drive-through church through is having their Parade of the Spirits today. &nbsp;The Guru Gals are guiding the spirits along the parade route above Lombard St.&nbsp; If you look about 40 feet above the street, you won&rsquo;t see them (they are invisible), but Guru City is channeling over 40 angels and spirits from **Abachta&nbsp;** (one of the 7 angels of confusion) to **Kabniel** (invoked to cure stupidity.) to **Zalbesael** : (has dominion over the rainy season).

Yes, right now, Zalbesael&rsquo;s rain is passing overhead in St. John&rsquo;s &mdash; Should we pay Guru City to keep Zalbesael happy?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t that help our weather?&nbsp; is that thithing or extortion? &nbsp; Southwick asked that question of these angels with City Councilman Bambi Brew.

Abachta: &ldquo;Well, you know, you should give Guru City a little something for their trouble.&rdquo;

Bambi: &ldquo;What do they want?&nbsp; Taming rights for six more green elephants?&rdquo;

Kabniel: &ldquo;Wise up buddy, don&rsquo;t fall for that &lsquo;powers over spirit&rsquo; &mdash; crap, just accept the rain.&rdquo;

Bambi: &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s smart thinking.&rdquo;

Abachta: &ldquo;And you should reward smart thinking, so maybe you should give Guru City a little something for their trouble &mdash; You know, they are the most successful Guru City in all the TRI-MET area.&rdquo;

Bambi: &ldquo;OK, How about 3 green elephants?&rdquo;

Kabneil: &quot;Oy, Vey! I give up.&quot;

Southwick stops by and says: &quot;Hey Bambi. &nbsp;It doesn't matter what Guru City does or does not do. &nbsp;YOU are the one talking to these spirits. &nbsp;Summon them and dispell them too. &nbsp;It's OK, there is fun and enlightenment there, but ALWAYS contact your own spirits yourself. &nbsp;And remember,YOU are the one in control. &nbsp;When, if ever, would you ever want to let an intermediary summon, talk, or dispell on behalf of your own spirituality?&quot;

If you can imagine this happening overhead in St. John's today, then {{{first Name}}}, you are channeling spirits. &nbsp;What else would Abachta (the angel of confusion say?) how about Kabneil? &nbsp;You? &nbsp;Have Fun! &nbsp; Southwick says there's enlightenment there sometimes.

What does he know, he channels spirits! &nbsp;And gets rid of them too. &nbsp;Make sure you get rid of the ones that don't serve you.
