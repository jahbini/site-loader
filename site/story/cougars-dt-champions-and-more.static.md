<p><span ><span >[First Name], You might want to check out the <em>Hope for Health</em> bar serving &quot;inner cleanse ale&quot; as indicated by the oddly smelling puddles in the parking lot. &nbsp;The <em>Hope for Health</em> bar, so named for an asian pun, caters to a clientelle who have so many medical problems, they come here to hope for health. &nbsp;A whopping 4.5 pukes!</span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >At least one wild cougar has been terrorizing Downtown Honolulu: The reports indicate that the cougars nab man-cubs with their wild ways, grab them kitten fashion up twenty story buildings. &nbsp;These 20 to 25 year old man-cubs stand no chance of avoiding the charms of these Yakuza of Grrl power, [First Name].

<p><span ><span >The city council has told me they want me to push St. John's as the &quot;amoeba free district.&quot; &nbsp;The facts about amoeba density in St. Johns needs to be brought out: amoebas are just not tolerated in St. John's. &nbsp;Bambi, of the city council went on: &nbsp;&quot;Published statistics about amoeba density in St. John's are vastly skewed to prevent true knowledge of the facts&quot;</span></span></p>
<p><span ><span ><span >OK, so we don't allow amoebas here. &nbsp;No shop is required to accept money from one of these low-lifes!

He won the Delirium Tremens three years in a row... &nbsp;It's a special thing for public transportation. &nbsp;Maybe Tri-Met gives you a badge and everything.</span></span></span></p>
