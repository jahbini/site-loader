Did you know that the reason you sneeze when you swab your ears?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because there is a tiny puff of air that comes out of the damn thing: It only goes off in your ear &mdash;&nbsp; amazing microtechnology.

I am helping Bambi of the City Council push this &ldquo;Amoeba Free Zone&rdquo; thing to business owners here in St. John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on a first name basis with many of these Kings of Pentacles, Randy, Theo, Suzanne, Hamid, and possibly you, {{{First Name}}}.&nbsp; King Suzanne?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; A king is more a &lsquo;function&rsquo; than a sex thing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what you do and why you do it.

The names above are struggling, stable, and upcoming business people in St. John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They create opportunities for employment for the Knights and Pages of Pentacles.&nbsp; They create opportunities for other businesses &mdash; other kings and kingdoms.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s part of the synergy of the pentacles: why they are so important.

Let me explain with this insight:

&quot;Gene, Gene, made a machine,

&nbsp;Joe, Joe, Made it go,

&nbsp;Hank, Hank, Turned the crank,

&nbsp;Art, Art let a fart and blew the whole damn thing apart&quot;

In Tarot terms Joe and Hank are both Pentacle guys, Joe likely a page, Hank is a Knight. &nbsp;Gene is a Wand suit guy, and Art? &nbsp;Well, Art is the Fool. &nbsp;The reason it blew apart? &nbsp;There was no King. &nbsp;The king is responsible for consequences. &nbsp;Art? &nbsp;Not so much.

Pentacles are the **_Git &lsquo;er done_** folk.&nbsp; Kings know, find and create&nbsp; _**&lsquo;er**_&nbsp; &mdash; that&rsquo;s what Kings do.&nbsp; The actual&nbsp;_**Git done**_&nbsp;part is the domain of the Knights and Pages of Pentacles. &nbsp; &nbsp;

What are Knights and Pages?&nbsp; From a Tarot standpoint, let&rsquo;s just say that the Knights are the core workers and hands-on managers, and the Pages are sales, marketing, administration. &nbsp; The King knows the space.&nbsp; Knows it very well. &nbsp;The King owns the space. &nbsp;If the space is &nbsp;perfume, he knows perfume. &nbsp;If it's baking, he knows baking. &nbsp;If it's rocket science, he knows the tech, and keeps his cool during launch and knows what his people are telling him: A [misfire][0] is worse than a no-fire.

Randy knows who supplies the best micro-brews.&nbsp; He stocks and runs his his place in the manner that he likes for the pleasant enjoyment of his customers. &nbsp;Randy or Hamid will give Throntle, our heroin hooker, the [bums rush][1] because chalking poop words on the sidewalk hurts business.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her.&nbsp; Neither Randy or Hamid or anyone hate Throntle, or really look down on her (well, maybe a little bit) but if she behaved (even a little bit!), she&rsquo;d be welcome.&nbsp; Like the wise say: &ldquo;Heroin isn&rsquo;t for everybody.&rdquo;

Totally Random question! :::&nbsp;What color are the Pope&rsquo;s Pyjamas?&nbsp; What he wears at night?&nbsp; Without looking it up! &nbsp;Cause that goes [nowhere][2]! &nbsp;(dont bother clicking that link. &nbsp;it really wont tell you.) &nbsp;Popes make few practical decisions.

Kings make practical decisions.&nbsp; If you sit down with Hamid and ask &ldquo;why did you make such-and-such a decision&rdquo; &mdash; and he can sit down and explain in simple terms that even a newbie dishwasher can understand.

Hamid, too. &nbsp;When I try to convince him that &quot;[Werm Tea][3]&quot; is the PERFECT name for a hot winter signature drink, Hamid thinks seriously and takes his time. &nbsp;More to figure out how to reel me in to sanity and not to make an actual decision.

Theo knows construction, and his ability to make problem solving decisions on 3 different jobs at one time is amazing.&nbsp; He just says Jesus does it. &nbsp;I think Jesus Connection is there, too. &nbsp;But if you ask him about a decision?&nbsp; Get him to slow down?&nbsp; Yes, he too, can explain in simple terms why and how a choice was made. &nbsp;Same thing with Suzanne&rsquo;s cafe.&nbsp; Practical.&nbsp; Goal directed.&nbsp; Knowledgeable.&nbsp; Aware.&nbsp; Effective.

When a king has not got that ability to relate to his Tarot Queen (The business itself &mdash; Just think that the king is married to the kingdom), the Knights, (the workers) and the Pages (eyes and ears), the kingdom does not thrive, and dwindles.&nbsp; Dumas had great fun commenting on the French Royalty&rsquo;s difficult history.&nbsp; But Louis the 16th wasn&rsquo;t the only king to lose touch with the essentials of his job.&nbsp; [A misfire is worse than a no-fire.][0]

A Knight or Page can become a king when the child grows up, to claim and defend the kingdom and husband it&rsquo;s prosperity.&nbsp; Kings are mature, and comfortable with being Practical, Goal Directed, Knowledgeable, Aware and Effective.&nbsp; Because business is business.

But when one of those essential elements is missing: being Aware, Knowledgeable.&nbsp; Not recognizing practicality. You name it. Then it&rsquo;s French Revolution time, or &ldquo;[Lord save us from the wrath of the Vikings][4]&rdquo; or &ldquo;[there isn&rsquo;t much call for buggy-whips anymore][5]&rdquo;

When it comes to business, it takes a king to make king sized decisions with king sized consequences: a King of Pentacles. &nbsp;You now have an idea of what a King must do and why.

What do you want on your Tombstone? &nbsp;Put this one on mine: &quot;He had a pleasant thought as he went into the light&quot; -- and he &quot;never accepted money from amoebas!&quot;
