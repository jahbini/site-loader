<p>&nbsp;Our houses are under attack! &nbsp;Mice. &nbsp;Well, mouse. &nbsp;It's cold, and wet outside. &nbsp;I'd want to keep warm and dry too.</p>
<div >
<p >Over at 3 Gunas Lp, Southwick tells me that Roger let the mouse in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&rsquo;s the story that Tommy is telling everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a big deal to Tommy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that he is afraid of them, or particularly worried about the&nbsp;hygiene&nbsp;of these critters.&nbsp; They pretty much follow Tommy&rsquo;s standards. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t pay rent.&nbsp; That would be a big problem for Tommy.&nbsp; Roger didn&rsquo;t hang around to find out, because, well&hellip; it&rsquo;s none of his business.</p>
<p >Tommy laid many traps and baits.&nbsp;&nbsp;He checks them.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gets a rush of happy if one is moved, and has it all in a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fantasticforum.com/1res/printthread.php?s=2f9b0b2067189f83d161350e300fd206&amp;threadid=6438">CIA dossier</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I say, It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13465624">big deal to Tommy</a>.</p>
<p >Southwick found the mouse stretched out on the kitchen floor when no one was around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this be an opportunity for a prank?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a dollhouse table and chair for the mouse, so that Tommy might see the results of the mouse&rsquo;s last dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Tommy have a sense of the macabre?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s hopin&rsquo;.</p>
<p >So much pompous braggadocio &mdash; there seems to be no room for honest laughter in his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s Southwick&rsquo;s aim, you know, to find the thing that a person needs the most, and help the person get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse, well, it&rsquo;s position in this will be honored &mdash; that&rsquo;s more than it&rsquo;d ever get otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Todays word from the Muse is brought to you by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/king-of-wands/">The King of Wands</a>, The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/queen-of-swords/">Queen of Swords</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/ten-of-pentacles/">Ten of Pentacles</a>. (At this point Kermit shouts: &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpiIWMWWVco&amp;feature=fvw">Ten of Pentacles!&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaay!</a>&rdquo;)</p>
<p ><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ge.com/company/history/edison.htm">Thomas Edison</a>&nbsp;is our revered national treasure of creativity. &nbsp;Well earned and well deserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know of his light bulbs and persistence.&nbsp;</p>
<p >But it was more than persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;He pursued his visions with a steam roller of passion!&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot blooded kill or be killed passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least when it came to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=edison+electrocutes+elephant&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">publically torturing elephants</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;He protected his ideas and fought his business enemies with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Empires-Light-Edison-Westinghouse-Electrify/dp/0375758844">Atilla the Lawye</a>r.</p>
<p >His enterprise lingers on in modern times: GE a mega corporation that just like Edison&rsquo;s existence: fabulously wealthy, an engine of great worth, but heart and soul? &nbsp;Sorry, that is an after market add-on and voids the warrantee.</p>
<p>Southwick, with his &quot;do unto others as they most deeply need&quot; bullshit, tells me this 10 of pentacles ending leaves us with this: the biggest need our mega-corporations have is pure cup.&nbsp;Compassion for humanity.&nbsp;</p>
