St. John's is lost.&nbsp; It was a vigorous area of Portland with mills, shops, shipping.&nbsp; And now, just the workers remain.&nbsp; Mostly in the bars.

Too many of these unemployed workers around to make the real switch to a gentrified neighborhood -- continual reminders of poverty DO tend to make the gentry squeamish.

And so St. John's waits in the gap between the past, and an uncertain future: the [bardo][0].

About me? -- &nbsp;I'm a [programmer][1] by trade, and have a pretty good track record of completing projects and such.&nbsp; Doing innovative stuff, bla, bla, bla.&nbsp; But economically, It's a very different story. &nbsp;I owe a butt-load of money to the Man, and he got more than Dog working for him. &nbsp; So I'm forced to hunt for work: an uncertain future -- the bardo.

But programming requires a meditation like [zen chess][2]. &nbsp;And worse, it steals time.&nbsp; Time, precious time that results in missing important things.&nbsp; Like packages have been left on your doorstep too long and have been returned to sender or that your house burned down.&nbsp; And worse: Zen Chess emits pheromones that just say NO to sex.&nbsp; Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be programmers.

Ouch: lets try a balance: &nbsp;Zen Chess in the AM, and dedicate the PM to writing. Fiction, stories, real stuff, crazy stuff, St. John's stuff. &nbsp;That's the most fascinating: the stories from Saint John's residents. &nbsp;All I need to do is pay attention. &nbsp;The St. John's Lighthouse will illuminate as many stories as I can transcribe.

So here I am in St. John's, trying to fill the bardo by writing down all the stories that I'm running into.&nbsp; The people here are fascinating, and {{{First Name}}}, here's one now: Gandalf is up at the counter:

Gandalf tells me: &quot;Next door to my house was an old lady in her 90's.&nbsp; She moved a few years ago to a nursing home. &nbsp; She sold to a couple of Mother Goddess worshippers who did some renovations and put a natural irrigation system in their back yard.&nbsp; Bingo! Body! &nbsp;Seems the old lady's husband was unfaithful too many times, and just went missing 50 years ago.

Gandalf continued: &quot;The new owners very, very quietly, did a cleansing, smudging, new agey blessing on the remains and report that the place is no longer haunted.&nbsp; The old lady is alive and happy in her rest home.&nbsp; A femur is used to stake the tomatoes.

Behind Gandalf in line, Samwise tells me about the shanghai tunnels.&nbsp; He says that they even start up here and go down to the Willamette.&nbsp; Followed the sewer tunnels mostly.&nbsp; Said there were tunnels under the Willamette. &nbsp;That's the way it was in 1880, you go to the wrong bar, get drunk, wake up on a ship sailing to Opium City. &nbsp;

Stories. &nbsp;You can't NOT hear the stories: the bardo of St. John's is filled with stories, isn't it, {{{First Name}}}?

St. John's still has hope of reaching the shore on the other side of the gap. &nbsp;Hope: I think it's somehow related to the Mona Lisa of Infrastructure we have here: The incredibly beautiful [St. John's Bridge][3]: Why so Beautiful? Why here where nobody can see it? But there it is: a vision of hope and beauty. &nbsp;Isn't the cosmic laughter pretty awesome?

I'm still in the bardo.&nbsp; Most everybody is in St. John's. &nbsp;But my writing is getting better, at least I hope so.&nbsp;It's the bridge. &nbsp;It gives hope that there is another shore on the other side: and until we find it, the view from the St John's Lighthouse continues to amaze.

I remain,

-- St. John's Jim
