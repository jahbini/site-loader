Per a reader's request for a story for diary entries about a Valkyrie. &nbsp;I changed the &quot;diary&quot; idea into using tweets instead; more of a challenge.

I got some background at this site -- [http://lokis-dottir.livejournal.com/68127.html][0]

I thought it might be fun to make Aubrun a low-ranking wage slave in some corporate heirarchy.

The following is intended to be a real-time twitter performance between two myth-tweets (mythical tweeters) -- hey, who says spiritual beings cant be on the internet.

Aubrun :&nbsp;- Valkerie &nbsp;-- Addresses her tweets to @Skuld

Skuld &nbsp;- Senior Valkerie &nbsp;-- replies back to @Aubrun

[Sessrumnir][1]:&nbsp;-- Valhalla's waiting station, A giant hall of limbo with wooden benches for the dead.

Skuld: @Aubrun assignment: 11/23/09 08:30 UTC You have been re-assigned to Darfur sector 3B. report immediately

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld K

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun upon arrival you will choose souls from only the dead, not like in your last assignment.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld but he was in a coma! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s as good as dead!

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun no, we went all over that during the inquiry. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know why Odin stepped in and gave you another chance, but wise up.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld OK, I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not to CHOOSE any but really dead souls from the battles.

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun That&rsquo;s right, returns are 2 expensive in temporal and spiritual corrections that must be made.

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun Begin your reports from Darfur sector 3B immediately.

Sessrumnir: &nbsp;@Skuld 11/23/09 08:45 UTC 1EA soul labeled 35273 deposited to Sessrumnir input

Sessrumnir: &nbsp;@Skuld 11/23/09 08:51 UTC 1EA soul labeled 35985 deposited to Sessrumnir input

Sessrumnir: &nbsp;@Skuld 11/23/09 08:52 UTC 1EA soul labeled 37226 deposited to Sessrumnir input

Aubrun :&nbsp;Sessrumnir numbers are going up fast! from 35273 to 37226 in 7 minutes! Too many dead today!&nbsp;

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun You know, I read that too, and you get paid. Just be happy you are still working

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld K, but it&rsquo;s lots of work and long hours down here as a Valkyrie.

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun You get maximum pay for your job specification. &nbsp;If you need, go to HR.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld No, I&rsquo;m not going to HR again: all smiles and coo-ing. &nbsp;Liars all.

Sessrumnir: &nbsp;@Skuld 11/23/09 09:11 UTC 1EA soul labeled 38177 deposited to Sessrumnir input

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld I'm at Sessrumnir processing says they have 4 souls destined for Valhalla, and want me to take them

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun Nix on the escort to Vahallah, you don&rsquo;t have seniority, and you are only qualified for 2 souls transport.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld &nbsp;Sorry, I already took all 4. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m in transit to Valhalla, I&rsquo;ll check in there.

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun Valhalla reports that you did not arrive as scheduled. &nbsp;U there?

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun U there? &nbsp;REPORT!

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun &nbsp;Where are you? &nbsp;What have you done with those souls??

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun Odin won&rsquo;t save you this time, you better check in NOW.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld Um. &nbsp;K. I&rsquo;m having a little trouble. &nbsp;Still en-route.

Skuld:&nbsp; @Aubrun &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t tell me you dropped a soul again! &nbsp;And this one was for Valhalla? &nbsp;Odin will be pissed.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld &nbsp;No sweat, just tell him that Loki tripped me up again.

Skuld: &nbsp;@Aubrun LOL! &nbsp;I used that excuse myself when I was still doing soul-transport. Always Works.

Aubrun: &nbsp;@Skuld yes Loki ALWAYS admits to everything just to piss ODIN off! :-)
