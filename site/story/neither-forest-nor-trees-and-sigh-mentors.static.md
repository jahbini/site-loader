<p >Late Fraking Blash! The Factory Underground has morphed into a new location above ground at <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=45.590669,-122.754756&amp;spn=0.002516,0.003551&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;msid=114144299215869109392.0004969fe04ec6e3cc721">John's Tavern</a>! &nbsp;All ages welcome!</p>
<p>Southwick was helping his friend the High Priestess of Wands with her dog &mdash; Yup, the bag broke just as he was retrieving the dog&rsquo;s offering to Mother Nature.&nbsp; As he was cleaning the poop off his fingers in November&rsquo;s river, he thought: &ldquo;Aha! I&rsquo;ll start a Doggy Bag recycling-reuse business!&rdquo;</p>
<p >That&rsquo;s one kind of Aha! &mdash; maybe not the wisest, Southwick.&nbsp; Another, more rewarding Aha! is when you discover a new way of seeing everyday things.&nbsp; From simple things to learning plant names and uses to more abstract patterns.</p>

<p >A <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi">mentor</a> delighted in showing me things hidden in plain sight.&nbsp; Very fun.&nbsp; She had an affinity for trees and lingered as she walked by a clump of palms or felt the hanging roots of a <a target="_blank" href="http://prateekv.wordpress.com/2008/12/24/limca-book-of-records-quiz-2008-prelims/banyan-tree/">banyan</a>.&nbsp; She mentioned that most of the curvy palms grow in clumps of three.&nbsp; They are like three gossiping dancers &mdash; maybe teenagers.</p>

<p >I looked around and even though I had been through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hiarmymuseumsoc.org/">Fort DeRussy</a> section of Waikiki hundreds of times, D&rsquo;oh! all the palms stopped growing randomly and clumped together without moving.</p>

<p >It&rsquo;s like that when you are given a pattern that fits the world.&nbsp; The world changes at the speed of thought. &nbsp; She delighted in my &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment.</p>

<p >And yes, it does seem that either by art or nature, palms on O&rsquo;ahu often grow in clumps of three.&nbsp; Graceful dancers lining the roadways and parks.&nbsp; Speaking to each other of <a target="_blank" href="http://gawker.com/5396065/lindsay-lohan-is-back-on-boys">important</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://gossipteen.com/">intimate</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=celeb+gossip+sites&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">ageless</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=sports+football+basketball+baseball&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">gossip</a>.</p>

<p >Next, she showed me a secret place.&nbsp; There are lots of secret places in Waikiki, but this one is in plain sight at Fort DeRussy and goes totally unnoticed.</p>

<p >You can&rsquo;t see it because it is neither forest nor tree.</p>

<p >The <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Waikiki,+Honolulu,+HI&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=Pub6TNb8NYmssAP3w4X3DQ&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=114144299215869109392.0004969f75c0606f90b80&amp;t=h&amp;z=20">secret place</a> is marked by several Emperor palms.&nbsp; These are the big-boy palms.&nbsp; Tall, serious and reassuring as an honest judge.&nbsp; They were laid out in an open rectangle.&nbsp; The open side of the rectangle faced several groups of dancing palms.</p>

<p >I would imagine it may have been a place for GI weddings during Ft DeRussy&rsquo;s heydays during WWII. &nbsp;Southwick would imagine it was a place for a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menehune">menehune</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/04/state-department-to-colum_n_792059.html">hukilau</a>.</p>

<p >The group is hard to spot now, a few of the emperor palms have died, and you might barely make out the depressions in the ground where a tree once stood.</p>

<p >Now and again, we would walk through this spot and marvel at the different feel this one spot of Waikiki had compared to the rest of the huhu of Waikiki.&nbsp; Calm, serene, joyous, maybe even reverent.</p>

<p >And just like the revelation that palms dance in threes, her knowledge allowed this place to no longer be Waikiki, no longer to be forest or tree, but a blissful place with regal oversight on one side and joyous dancers on the other.&nbsp; All at the speed of thought.&nbsp; She delighted in my &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment of this scene too.</p>

<p >This mentor, like other ghosts in Honolulu, is no more, as mentors always are.&nbsp;</p>

<p ><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kenwilber.com/home/landing/index.html">Ken Wilber</a> speaks of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)">Holons</a> &mdash; grouping of elements to make new structure out of smaller parts.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pattern that is repeated everywhere in every domain: from quarks to atoms to galaxies; from sounds to syllables to words and speech &mdash; dialects and languages; from genus to phylum.&nbsp; Hero and Mentor.&nbsp; Values and emotions too.</p>

<p >Hermes Trismegistus (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=hermes+trismegistus&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Hermy</a> to his friends,)&nbsp;would say: &quot;As above, so below.&quot;</p>

<p >I love the &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; reactions I get pointing out patterns of interaction to people. &mdash; like the concept of easy and difficult rapport: How hard do you have to work to get rapport with someone?&nbsp; Long term relationship with limited rapport? Ugh.</p>

<p >Or like the patterns of values and emotions we gather from birth.&nbsp; We use them over and over as building blocks for our paths in life.&nbsp; Getting the rocks, tree trunks and potholes off the path and glimpsing the destination is what <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/">Bliss Boulevard</a> is all about.</p>

<p >The December special is a free Bliss Quest session &mdash; a $90 value.&nbsp; A Bliss Quest is quick tour into your own internal Waikiki.&nbsp; Destination? A blissful place hidden in plain sight.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p >In December, I&rsquo;ll continue to do Tarot Readings, but this month is a <b><i>MUCH</i></b> better deal, since I am raising the &ldquo;street price&rdquo; of a Tarot reading to $100.00.</p>

<p ><i>Aren&rsquo;t you glad you waited?</i></p>
