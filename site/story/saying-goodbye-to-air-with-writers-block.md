Everybody already has this figured out, but I'll say it again:&nbsp; I notice things here in Portland.&nbsp; Mostly things that contrast with what I've known for the last 20 years in Hawaii.&nbsp; Things that mainlanders take for granted.&nbsp; Things that Kama Aina take for granted.

I'm needing to take drastic action on a relationship that I can no longer avoid.&nbsp; It pains me greatly. It's a problem in my love affair with St. john's. It is the air.

Oregon air is good. clean ocean air meets big trees.

Hawaiian air is good. &nbsp; 100% purified by 2000 miles of Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; Unless you go one haoli building, you breathe good air.&nbsp; Except maybe no trades, and you gotta breathe Pele stink breath from Big Isle, den you go haoli building, OK.

But Hawaiian air is reliable.&nbsp; Your warmth is welcome in my bed nearly every day of the year: come caress me with your eyelash strokes at midnight.&nbsp; Hawaiian air is the Venus of climates.

Oregon air is too hot, too cold, too wet, too dry.&nbsp; It's the Annie Hall of climates: seductive somehow while wearing an ill-fitting man's suit.

_Annie, I have to tell you this:&nbsp; It pains me greatly as our love affair rounds out the year: I feel you getting colder, Annie, and I'm sorry, but it's late October and I'm just going to have to close the window at night.&nbsp; We'll still have the daytime._

I close the window. &nbsp;A silent voice calls me from across the room: &quot;Sweetie, come make love with me. &nbsp;We can be so sweeet together. &nbsp;I'll get you started, and you can fill us both up with thrills.&quot;

It's the Pen, my demon bitch goddess of prose, she has the curves of the St. John's Bridge. &nbsp;I answer: &quot;Not tonight, I'm empty of essence like the bull after the fight.&quot; &nbsp;She is insistent: &nbsp;&quot;Come and hold me, I'm cold... &nbsp;Mmmm?&quot;

I surrender. &nbsp;I hold her. &nbsp;I write. &nbsp;It is pablum. &nbsp;Passionless Drivel. &nbsp;I sob: &nbsp;&quot;I want to, but I can't. It's just not there tonight, honey.&quot;

She responds: &nbsp;&quot;It's all right, you can do it. &nbsp;Soon. &nbsp;I know. &nbsp;Just hold me.&quot;

_Just hold me._ It starts all over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why Selsun Blue is no longer blue. &nbsp;I wonder what the rumors about giant spiders mean.

And that's writer's block Sunday in St. John's!
