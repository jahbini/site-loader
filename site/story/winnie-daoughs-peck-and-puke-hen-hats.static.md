Well, [First Name], they are more like helmets, and are really painted on, and she likely should have used the name <em>Peck-and-Panic</em>&hellip;  But I digress.</p>
<p>Winnie Daough, you may remember is a whiz-a-holic for creating organic niche products out of found materials.  She patented the twig straightener and the blackberry-thorn necklace stringing machine.  Blackberry thorn necklaces were a fad in Portland for 2 weeks in 1986, but Winnie has perfected her machine since then.</p>
<p>Winnie is totally practical when it comes to her life&rsquo;s essentials - in this case, exotic hens.  These are her special passion.  My eyes glaze over when she mentions the &ldquo;radiated doohicky&rdquo; or the &ldquo;passion pistol, bambino cross.&rdquo;  I infer that these are different breeds or chicken neuroses or such.</p>
<p>She shoots me a look that clearly suggests that I&rsquo;m in over my head: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unique head feather arrangement, you dummy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess that her birds did have handsome top-knots, but I was amazed to hear that there are bird-head conventions and bingo parties at the local armory each Friday evening.</p>
<p >[First Name]: &ldquo;<em>What?!?  You mean St. John&rsquo;s has an armory?!!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p >St. John's Jim: &quot;Damndest thing I ever sawd. &nbsp;No armory. &nbsp;I guess twern't profitable, by cracky!&quot;</p>
<p>Winnie went on to tell me that her biggest problem was hen-pecking order and those beloved top-knots. An unter-chicken gets pecked and goes bald, and that means lost profits. &nbsp;Winnie was not going to let some uber-chicken screw with anybodies top-knot.</p>
<p>Winnie concocted a batch of hen-hat goo that she put on daily.  The first batch was based on super-glue, but having a beak stuck to a hens top-knot reduced its value on auction night.</p>
<p>By the fourth batch, Winnie has hit on yet another amazing use for some household animal by-product.  You should thank me that I didn&rsquo;t ask what it was.  She told me anyway.  Cat drool.</p>
<p>The long and short of the product is that when a hen pecks another, the pheromones of the cat get released on to the offending hen and she starts spewing at both ends and running away from herself.  A feat that only a frightened hen can achieve.  Or society.</p>
<p>And then I asked the key question: &ldquo;Winnie: Are you sure it&rsquo;s legal to deal in chicken scalps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Winnie replied: &ldquo;Yup, I'm making out big time, and they&rsquo;ll make that illegal too, soon enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p >That's the way it is in St. John's on February 9, 2011. &nbsp;Where it is tourist season every day at rush hour for 45 minutes. &nbsp;Then they go to sleep. &nbsp;They are gone by morning.</p>
