<p>I&rsquo;m starting this year as if everything will be fabulous.  Screw the resolutions, Let&rsquo;s go for end-times perfection.  Hey, let&rsquo;s plan big in 2011.</p>
<p>Try these rhymes to the tune of Big Rock Candy Mountain. &nbsp;You know: where the flying pigs wear lipstick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the Year of  Twenty &lsquo;leven, Our congress finall- y   sane<br />
the gas-bags learn humility, and   we   keep  them on a chain<br />
The red states want to kiss the blue and the world will link up, too<br />
and the Taxes paid when peace is made<br />
and the laws make sense and not offense<br />
in the Year of  Twenty &lsquo;leven</p>
<p>in the Year of  Twenty &lsquo;leven, old terrors lose their wrath<br />
the babies all are wanted too and helped along their path<br />
All parents are the perfect ones for the daughters and the sons<br />
the sins of the past are gone at last<br />
and all we miss will return as bliss<br />
in the Year of  Twenty &lsquo;leven<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p >and if not in 2011, then maybe in 3011.</p>
<p>What did I learn from all this? Aligning syllables, accents and meter is a royal pain!</p>
<p><em>Happy New Year!</em></p>
