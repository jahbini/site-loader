<p>People used to smoke. &nbsp;Lots. &nbsp;Many still do, I'm not ag'in it. &nbsp;People are vegetarians now. &nbsp;I'm not ag'in it.</p>
<p>If butts could talk, the only way we could tell them is by the brand.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Kool:  Hey, hey, another ash in the tray!  Looks like some new butt&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; our way.</p>
<p>Marlboro: Mmm.  Could be somethin&rsquo;, Could be nothin&rsquo; &mdash; don&rsquo;t get excited.</p>
<p>Kool:  Last butt here had some real hot embers to share.  Oh. Look, another cig.  That means there are two!</p>
<p>Marlboro: Could be anything.  Maybe her aunt.  Maybe her roommate.</p>
<p>American Spirit:  I recognize my brand, my smoke, my savor.  I bet it&rsquo;s from Harry.</p>
<p>Kool:  No.  Sue gave Harry the boot Tuesday.   Hey?  You Kool Too?  I&rsquo;m Kool.</p>
<p>Kool: Yeah!  Kool.  I&rsquo;m Sue&rsquo;s.  You?</p>
<p>Kool:  Yeah.  All us Kool&rsquo;s are Sue&rsquo;s.  Even the ones without lipstick.</p>
<p>Kool:  Not me, I&rsquo;m Stephen&rsquo;s!  &mdash; He stole one in the wee hours.</p>
<p>American Spirit:  Who&rsquo;s Stephen?</p>
<p>Marlboro:  Grrr.  Get with it has-been.  Harry is history.  It&rsquo;s me or Steven now.  He smokes Camels mostly.</p>
<p>Kool: Give it up, Marlboro.  You are just a cigarette butt.  You were only joined to Carl for about five minutes at most, and then he just crushed you.  Like all the rest of us.</p>
<p>Kool: Yeah, I like you, er. Sue likes Carl, but Steven is lots more fun.  You both have a shot.</p>
<p>(Stub, Stub&hellip; Smash)<br />
American Spirit: Oh, my crap.  That hurts.  I was on fire, happy, joining with Sam, and then he just slammed me here.  OMG.  What a headache.</p>
<p>Marlboro:  Sam!  What!  You were smoked by SAM?!? Who the hell is Sam?</p>
<p>Camel:  Oh, Marlboro, you don&rsquo;t even know Sue&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s friends.  You are going Down!  Sue will dump you sure.</p>
<p>(Stub, Stub, Stub&hellip;  Grind, smash.)<br />
Kool: Ohhhhhh.  Wheeeuuuu.  That was crazy.  Missy and I were enjoying the long ride down from the great feelings that Missy was feeling with Sam, and then Missy heard something, took a last drag and bam!   I&rsquo;m history.</p>
<p>Camel:  Hmm.  Missy and Sam? &nbsp;Missy! &nbsp;Looks like you have a problem with your daughter, Sue.</p>
<p>Kool:  Oh, shit.  When Sue finds out she will be all over those two like nails in a coffin.</p>
<p>Marlboro:  I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to be Sam right now.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; some time later &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; <br />
American Spirit, Camel, Kool, Marlboro:  Look another ash!  Maybe news!</p>
<p>(Stub.   Grind.   Stub, stub, stub.   Grind. &hellip;  smash)</p>
<p>Kool:  Uggggh.  Ohhhhh. Hhhuuuuuu.  I tried.  I&rsquo;m sorry Sue.  I gave you all the nicotine I had.  I couldn&rsquo;t do anything except be with you as you realized your kid was becoming a woman.  Just like you, Sue.  It will be all right.</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>Like I say, I'm not ag'in smokers. &nbsp;Nor vegetarians. &nbsp;Ashtrays have more interesting conversations -- prove me wrong.</p>
