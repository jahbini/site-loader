It&rsquo;s a bright and clear Fall morning.&nbsp; The rain has stopped and the spiders are out again.&nbsp; Spinning webs.&nbsp; Spiderfest 2010 hopeful [Bamboo Willy][0] didn&rsquo;t make it through the torrents of rain recently and was last seen spiraling down the Smith Street drainage system.&nbsp; I suspect that the Willamette River is his address now.

The first prize in the _catch-em-wrap-em_ contest of Spiderfest 2010 went to the [Willow Twins][1] on N St. John's Ave.&nbsp; As i passed them I saw them enjoying the prize: a smelly coral shaped fungus that erupted overnight and is drawing bugs like crazy.&nbsp; I let the twins go on their path: _respect_, my fellow travelers on spaceship earth.

A few steps later, Southwick runs up to me sputtering: &ldquo;Bear-Spinners!&nbsp; We forgot all about them!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re coming! Monster Spiders! OMG!&rdquo;&nbsp; I think Southwick is afraid of spiders.&nbsp; Maybe a little too much.

Over at 3 [Gunas][2] Lp, Southwick got up early today:&nbsp; That is, Tommy got up early, all in a hub-bub about Halloween and woke everybody up.

Tommy said: &ldquo;OMG Last night was trick or tread, and we handed out rocks to the kids.&nbsp; But tonight is real Oct 31!&nbsp; How can there be two Halloweens?&rdquo;

Southwick wanted to know: &ldquo;It's trick or _treat_, Tommy. Rocks? That sucks.&nbsp; Halloween is Sunday and everybody goes to work tomorrow, so they did the trick-or-treat on the 30th. Why rocks?&rdquo;

Tommy says: &ldquo;These are Oregon rocks.&nbsp; The best.&nbsp; We dredge &lsquo;em up.&nbsp; We got lot&rsquo;s of them at Waterfront U.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not the important thing-&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the Grizzly Spinners, they are out tonight, not last night, and the kids won&rsquo;t be out.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll take over Pier Park!&rdquo;

Roger, the Professor of Preventive Maintenance, chimes in: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big thing, the cougar will take care of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; When pressed about what he knows about the Hawaiian Cougar that Southwick imported, Roger will only say: &ldquo;All I know is that she&rsquo;s not the [mahu from Oahu][3]&rdquo; -- {{{First Name}}}, what the heck can that mean?

Southwick is having a fit: &quot;The kids have some sort of mojo to repel these nasty spiders each Halloween, but without the neighborhood search and seizure parade on Oct 31, we&rsquo;re gonna have man-eating spiders in Pier Park!&nbsp; Falling out of the sky!&nbsp; The sky!&nbsp; Falling!&nbsp; The sky!&nbsp; Falling!!&nbsp; OMG!!!!&rdquo;

{{{First Name}}}, Let me explain: Tonight is real Halloween.&nbsp; The scary night.&nbsp; The guys over at the Crystal Hookah Church and Roach Coach won&rsquo;t even go outside their hookah on October 31st. &nbsp; Every time I get something from Southwick, I find solid evidence in the testimony of Sandy, the Delirium Tremens expert from the parking lot of the &ldquo;Hope for Health&rdquo; bar.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see him tomorrow.&nbsp; He will have the REAL vomit!

But I have a confession. &nbsp;OMG. &nbsp;Do I have to confess? &nbsp;Will it make me feel better?

There is something I&rsquo;ve been carrying in my backpack for too long.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a copy of William Faulkner&rsquo;s &ldquo;As I Lay Dying&rdquo; &mdash; It&rsquo;s extra heavy because I got the edition with 300 pages of masturbatory analysis.&nbsp; Faulkner got a Nobel prize.&nbsp; Masturbators, start your engines!

OMG, Faulkner is scary.&nbsp; Not my favorite author.&nbsp; His characters have a weird spider crawling through the thoughts of each character spinning out the web of the story.&nbsp; His character&rsquo;s think in dialect carefully curried to have a demented quality.&nbsp; Let me repeat that: they THINK in dialect.&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s a pretty powerful literary device.&nbsp; But even Faulkner stumbles every so often: The second chapter labelled &ldquo;Dewey Dell&rdquo; in his work: &ldquo;As I Lay Dying&rdquo; has the sentence &mdash; &ldquo;_He could do everything for me if he just knowed it. The cow breathes upon my hips and back, her breath warm, sweet, stertorous, moaning_.&rdquo; (This sentence included under fair use provisions and against my better judgement, but hey, I'm no Faulkner.)

OK, we get it Mr Faulkner: Dewey Dell is simpleminded, obsessed, afraid, unschooled, but astutely paying attention to the physical aspects of life.&nbsp; But where would _she_ ever come up with the word &ldquo;[stertorous][4],&rdquo; &nbsp;for &quot;snoring&quot;? &nbsp;I'm sure Dewey is familiar with snoring.... Hmm?? {{{First Name}}}, If a Nobel laureate can make such a gaffe, there may be hope for St. John&rsquo;s Jim as a writer.

For me?&nbsp; When I read that, after wading through the dismal terrain of humanity you celebrate, I threw the book on the floor, picked it up so I could throw it down again.&nbsp; Then I used the pages to wipe my okole and then I sterilized my tookus.&nbsp; Thanks, Faulkner, you give me hope.

OMG, is it OK to not like Faulkner?&nbsp; gee, I guess it is. &nbsp;And with that thought I gain freedom. {{{First Name}}}, can you gain freedom from allowing yourself to like or dislike what ever you want? &nbsp;Sure you can.
