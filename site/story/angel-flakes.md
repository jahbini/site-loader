Mr. Weatherman:

&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha! The sky didn&rsquo;t fall, Chicken Little!&nbsp; The one to three inches of snow was the latest of overblown stories.&nbsp; But we did get cold. &nbsp;The very same weathermen say It is not supposed to thaw today at all.&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s worthy.&nbsp; Cold and dry. &nbsp; Much better than a PNW day of&nbsp;cold and wet.

The worst part of cold is all the layers of cloth I have to deal with in the Men&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Layer upon layer, each with some highly byzantine secret hand sign to pass to the next layer to free the prisoner within.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s sure to end badly at the urinal at Slim&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Pray for my sphincters.

Actually, you might pray for and honor YOUR sphincters, not mine.&nbsp; You may consider that each part of you responds to praise and warmth just as your ego does.&nbsp; As above, so below:&nbsp; We are full of reward responsive neural centers. &nbsp;[Praise activated][0].&nbsp; Praise yourself and all your 1001 parts, cause you are, they are, fabulous, {{{First Name}}}. &nbsp;Praise the bladder, too.

The walk into town was punctuated by several mysterious, unrelated events.&nbsp; Swirling snowflakes in the sunlight &mdash; not a cloud in the sky. But these were not your traditional wind blown snow. &nbsp;Tiny, nearly invisible except for angelic glints:&nbsp; Angel Flakes dancing in the street.&nbsp; A good portent.

In Honolulu the rain sometimes comes down like that - ['Awa][1]:&nbsp; The tiniest drops with no cloud in the sky: The [Pali Lookout][2] makes a perfect atomizer as the wind sprays honolulu with the sweetest Angel Kisses.&nbsp; Very Nice.

A woman down the street shouted &ldquo;Thanks for your Stories&rdquo; &mdash; I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t recognize you, was that you, {{{First Name}}}?

The leaves in the park crunched again as I walked over them.&nbsp; Even the blades of grass attempted to support me &mdash; the crunch signaling their failure.&nbsp; I salute you, fallen blades of grass, you attempted the impossible, and I honor your part in life.

I&rsquo;m asked to take sides by the City Council.&nbsp; Who in their right mind would care what St John&rsquo;s Jim thinks?&nbsp; Do they think somebody actually reads these e-mails?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; The power of the pen &mdash; May I avoid poking it in my own eye.

These are all examples of Angel Flakes.&nbsp; Tiny, almost un-noticible nice things.&nbsp; All around. Notice them!&nbsp; Take full advantage of encouragement, beauty, nicer than expected weather, hints and apparitions of sweet memories.&nbsp; Each one is a tiny, tiny sip of a [three of cups][3] pleasure &mdash; the pleasure that is gone in a moment. Chasing pleasure is doomed, but enjoying pleasure is not. &nbsp; Add these joys up, and you are a joy magnet.

So look for these Angel Flakes, they are a nice ally in the fight against anger or depression.&nbsp; Your sphincters will approve.
