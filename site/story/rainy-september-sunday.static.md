<p><span ><span >(Jim's note: &nbsp;I got a big backlog of stories, and hope to get this distribution thing working with as few surprises as possible. &nbsp;Thanks for your patience as I get all the subscribe/unsubscribe HTML links in place and under control)</span></span></p>
<p>Yesterday was warm and bright and humid.&nbsp; As the afternoon sun mellowed a bit, the light filtering through the trees brought out the tiny zits on the face of our sweet nature pentacle goddess: Portland.&nbsp; Nature, for all her beauty, is intimate with a few ookie things that we rather ignore.</p>

<p >Not yesterday:&nbsp; The bugs were everywhere.&nbsp; Tiny midges thick in air of the avenues.&nbsp; When the sun dims behind a cloud, the midges magically disappear: I breath easier, then I realize the flies are still there, and each breath is likely sucking in three or four of these protein filled vermin.&nbsp; So what do I do about it?&nbsp; Continue walking.&nbsp; Get to Storybook Theatre before Happy Hour ends and find a great story to write.&nbsp; In fact, a King of Pentacles shared his secret with me, but that's another story.</p>

<p >That was yesterday.&nbsp; This is today, and this story is about ookie midges.&nbsp; And their fate.&nbsp; Nature knows it takes ookie to fight ookie, and the midge's ookiest predator is the spider.</p>

<p >I'm walking into St. John's in the rain.&nbsp; Rain freshens the air, washes the streets and spatters droplets onto the webs, making them as visible as the midges were yesterday.&nbsp; One proud spider, as plump as a Belgian Burgher, has imagineered a web that seems to support its bamboo thicket, rather than the other way around.&nbsp; Tiny drops on the web make like lighthouses for the midges' radar: <em>&quot;Breaker, Breaker, this is garbage-guy-23, be advised of a spider web two clicks NorthWest of the mildewed dog poop.&nbsp; That is all.&quot;</em></p>

<p >The droplets on the webs are as tiny and shiny as the bugs were tiny and black.&nbsp; Sparkling with the sun behind, but nearly invisible from the other side.&nbsp; If I were walking in the other direction, there would be no visible droplets, no visible webs.&nbsp; As the sun dries the webs and brings out the midges, the spiders will make a killing, as they say in Pentacle Town.</p>

<p >It's like that with stories.&nbsp; You have to look at the day as if you were several people at once.&nbsp; From all angles of perception and emotionality.&nbsp; And then bring out the highlights of the moments.&nbsp; Some are ookie.&nbsp; Some are hilariously ookie.</p>

<p >I walk along a bit further, and spot Southwick coming out of his place on 3 Gunas Loop.&nbsp; He says hi, and we talk a bit as we walk.&nbsp; Southwick wants to get away from his roommates for a while: it seems that his room-mate Tommy is out to erase his recent lady problems by using monetary negotiation as an aid to seduction.&nbsp; Tommy told Southwick to get showered up and the very friendly lady was going to arrive soon and take on the world for a bit of help with her house payment.</p>

<p >Southwick tells me that he is kind of appalled at the idea, but Tommy has the morals of, well, um. Er. &nbsp; Actually Southwick has no idea of the depths that Tommy's morals go.&nbsp; Can't be lower than the urges and actions of our midges and spiders, can it?&nbsp; And well, we do things for lots of reasons.</p>

<p >It took Southwick a few minutes to come up with the most outrageous answer to Tommy, one that takes a tiny dig at Tommy's manhood:&nbsp; &quot;<em>If I have to get washed up, she's not the kind of woman I want to be with</em>&quot; --&nbsp; Nature knows it takes ookie to fight ookie.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
