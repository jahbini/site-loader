&nbsp;Last night, the Oregon rain reached the millisecond 100% saturation point:&nbsp; Everything instantly wet, through and through.&nbsp; Even my backpack.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s pretty amazing.

As I lay my tarot out to dry on the pool table of my cathedral of solitude under the Art Gallery, I hit upon this incredible scheme to wake the Muse. &nbsp;Shuffle and pick three cards: A destination, and two motif cards.&nbsp; The destination is &ldquo;across the bridge&rdquo; and the two motif cards are what might happen.

Today&rsquo;s three cards are the [10 of Cups][0],&nbsp; [The Magician][1], and [The Tower][2].&nbsp; Too easy.

Southwick wanted to start the internet candle-lighting service, you know like votive candles in monasteries. VotiveSix.com -- &ldquo;We keep the light going&rdquo; &mdash; He would convert a warehouse into a series of altars stacked up like Cosco Shelves.&nbsp; He would rent out each altar, complete with burning candle, webcam and prayer of your choice repeated endlessly.&nbsp; Rental would be by the week, with automatic &ldquo;keep burning&rdquo; service for _ONLY_ ten percent extra!

The service became an instant success, and Southwick&rsquo;s candle empire grew.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the VP Of WebCams began diverting funds away from web-cams, and started showing customers the very same candle!&nbsp; The public outcry caused riots at Wall Street, [Tristan da Cunha][3], and San Quentin Maximum Security.&nbsp; The losses were staggering as it became clear that the major customers were top bankers, politicians, and executives, who basically only have prayers as assets.

Southwick&rsquo;s empire faded, he decided that he would tend his own gardens and would keep his candles burning in his heart.&nbsp; At the end, he had wondrous thoughts of thankfulness as he walked into the light.

See?&nbsp; Too easy.

Hmm.&nbsp; Maybe we could hire holy men to pray to each altar.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you just imagine Bishops riding fork-lifts around a warehouse maze of mini altars?

Southwick is sure&nbsp;the Bankers would pay top dollar for that service,&nbsp; Hell, it&rsquo;s only money in the [Fed&rsquo;s][4] imagination anyway.

I'm sure that thought will comfort me as I slog home in torrents of H2O radiation from the sky.
