<p>&ldquo;They have no lights on their condos.&rdquo;  He looked intently at me. &nbsp;He wanted validation and we would be best buddies.  I replied: &ldquo;Yes, no lights.&rdquo;  Always agree.  Simply acknowledge.  It&rsquo;s a Ninja Trick when you are confronted with a feeble old grouch. &nbsp;Keep Walking.</p>
<p>I walked passed him as he pointed over to the <a target="_blank" href="http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/MALVINA/mr094.htm">tiki-taki</a> across the street, shouting: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put lights on your condos&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was a bit baffled, I did see porch lights, and it was daylight.  What kind of lights was he thinking of?  This is when I wish I was a member of the Church of Who Gives A Fuck.  I look back and he is still spouting off to the building as he shuffles his walker along.  Did he want a neon sign? Theatre spotlights?  An enema? &mdash; it would give him something else to think about.</p>
<p>The hooker on duty in front of the Hope for Health bar vaguely threatens some people waiting for the bus: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess with me, I do blow jobs to get that testoster crap.&rdquo;  She has her hand on something in her purse.  Keep walking.  Where did she learn a big word like that?</p>
<p>Phone Jack walks stiffly and has a booming chant like an ah-uuu-ga horn: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m OK, I&rsquo;m OK.  No Gun, No Gun.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dog Green Excrement Recycle.&rdquo; He usually repeats everything he says at least twice.   It never makes any sense whatsoever.  He thinks he is invisible &mdash; No one ever notices him because he is talking on a pay-phone.  Yes, shouting through a pay phone, hanging up and dialing repeatedly without putting coins in is a perfect disguise.</p>
<p>Nobody, but nobody, screws with Phone Jack. &nbsp;Very bad Juju to screw with someone who has the intellectual skills of a Labrador Retriever. &nbsp;Keep walking.</p>
<p>The owner of an empty lot tells me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put a volleyball court here, I think it would be a big hit in the Spring and Summer.&rdquo;  - I reply &ldquo;Yes, Spring and Summer.&rdquo;  Simply acknowledge.  It&rsquo;s a Ninja Trick when you are confronted with a Business Genius.  It&rsquo;s the perfect idea for a lot on an industrial arterial with no parking or foot traffic. &nbsp;Yup, you guessed it: &nbsp;Keep walking.</p>
<p>I bet an enema would give him something else to think about.  That ninja trick wouldn&rsquo;t work on Phone Jack though. &nbsp;No brains, no headaches.</p>
<p>Southwick walks over to me and says: &ldquo;The fungus beneath our feet is a whole universe of beings.&rdquo;  I reply &ldquo;Yes, beings.&quot; and keep walking. &nbsp;He says: &quot;The &lsquo;shrooms want me to be their drug dealer.&quot; I reply, &quot;Yes, dealer&hellip; <i>Dealer</i>? What the?&rdquo;  But by then, I have muffed my damned Ninja Trick and I&rsquo;m trapped.</p>
<p>Shit, I should have talked to the shuffler guy and I would have avoided this.  I say: &ldquo;Are you getting fungally probed again?  Are you getting high on &lsquo;shrooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Southwick replies: &ldquo;No, &nbsp;It's them, <i><b>they</b></i> want me to get <i><b>them</b></i> high though.  The &lsquo;shrooms want me to be their drug dealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s the craziest thing that I&rsquo;ve ever heard on the street. &nbsp;I got to find out more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s St. John&rsquo;s.  Just when you thought you figured it out, there is a whole new subculture existing in a parallel dimension.&nbsp;</p>
