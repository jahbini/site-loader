Howzit, {{{First Name}}}, let us contemplate the great sea of human energy from our secret haven, the James John Cafe.

This is [Soccer][0] Saturday, and you can't get a more energetic sea of young energy than these little boys squirt. As I pass a very large bush, I see a whole team perched on the branches. I stop to listen. Are they guarding the bush from other teams? Plotting strategy?

It seems that little boys are still addicted to [King of the Mountain][1], like spontaneous combustion: "I'm highest, you are 2nd, you 3rd, 4th, 5th" -- "I'm 3rd, Joey's 4th" -- "Nuh uh, he's not 2nd." Ms Soccer Mom, are you getting your money's worth of character building today?

I still marvel at the amount of webs. I have been told that the spiders up in [Forest Park][2] get much bigger. And weirder, too. Some tree shrews have evolved to the point they can make webs. Evolution rules! Take that, Mr. TV Evangelist. I gotta check this lead out. 

Speaking of weird, {{{First Name}}}, The St. John's Town Council voted to mandate **Normalcy Appreciation**. Every person can report each day that passes without a "strangeness alert" for them. The person who has the least amount of "Strange Days" will win a Normal amount of Appreciation from the council. {{{Roger}}}, from 3 Gunas Lp, currently holds the record with 15 days of Normal. Strange happens very often in St. John's.

Sammie, the friendly crack lady, tells me she lives outside near the river and loves to wake up watching the boats. She misses the sailors. She says they don't come up to St. John's anymore. She mentions her IQ of 148. Every time she took the web IQ test at the Library, she got a higher score. She said she got smarter real quick that day. Her record for Normalcy is about average.

My Strange Days have been down to 2 in the past couple of weeks. {{{First Name}}}, how about you?
