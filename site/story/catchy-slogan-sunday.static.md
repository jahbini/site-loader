<p >The James John Cafe ran out of hollandaise sauce.&nbsp; Rats.&nbsp; The eggs benedict are fit for a pope.&nbsp; Wahh, my stomach cries for comfort food, which is a no-brainer:&nbsp; I order the awesome chops.&nbsp; Mmm, very tasty. &nbsp;It's Sunday in October and the weather in St. John's today has the trademark stamp of San Francisco's bone chilling Summers.&nbsp; This is the kind of day that you think twice about closing a door because the great refrigerator light in the sky might go out.</p>

<p >The kind of day that speaks of Winter's ice slosh in the socks.&nbsp; The G.I. Bill paid for my two degrees in Computer Science, but without much left over for shoes, creating a huge gap in my impoverished student armor against the half-frozen slop that covered the ground. &nbsp;A little salted ice between the toes can really make a boring lecture intolerable.</p>

<p >I got better shoes now.&nbsp; Some others here in St. John's don't.&nbsp; Bill, The G.I., doesn't pay for shoes either,&nbsp; Maybe that's what we need.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.firesigntheatre.com/albums/album.php?album=sfi">Shoes for Industry</a>.&nbsp; A catchy slogan.</p>

<p >I mentioned the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasantville_(film)">Town Council</a> had begun to appreciate Normalcy.&nbsp; I had a chance to talk to the head of the Council: Bambi Brew.&nbsp; Bambi is a young buck with a broken nose, antlers and a '50's flattop haircut, and started the conversation by noting: &quot;Hey, I know: Bambi.&nbsp; It's really a man's name... Watch <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi">the movie</a>.&quot; Other than that, the interview went, well, normally.&nbsp; Technically, I am still interviewing him, the interview is not over until we reach <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calvinwarr.com/marketing/361/leadership-by-consensus/">Oregon State Consensus</a>. &nbsp;Another catchy slogan.</p>

<p >Roger, the retired Navy guy over at 3 Gunas Lp came in early this morning from out of town, He field-stripped his Harley, applied extra coats of gun oil on every part, restored calm to the neighborhood and raised his count of Normal Days up to 16.&nbsp; He has an appointment tomorrow to have his fingerprints re-certified.&nbsp; Tommy, at the same address, had ridden his 1200cc crotch-rocket up the walkway to each door distributing literature for the Church of Who Gives a Fuck. &quot;<em>Honey, will you get the door? Ask him if it's terror or temptation today.</em>&quot;&nbsp; From what I'm told, the WGAF may be Portland's biggest church. It does have a catchy slogan.</p>
