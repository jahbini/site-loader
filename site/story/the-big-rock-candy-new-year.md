I&rsquo;m starting this year as if everything will be fabulous. Screw the resolutions, Let&rsquo;s go for end-times perfection. Hey, let&rsquo;s plan big in 2011.

Try these rhymes to the tune of Big Rock Candy Mountain. &nbsp;You know: where the flying pigs wear lipstick.

> in the Year of Twenty &lsquo;leven, Our congress finall- y sane  
> the gas-bags learn humility, and we keep them on a chain  
> The red states want to kiss the blue and the world will link up, too  
> and the Taxes paid when peace is made  
> and the laws make sense and not offense  
> in the Year of Twenty &lsquo;leven

> in the Year of Twenty &lsquo;leven, old terrors lose their wrath  
> the babies all are wanted too and helped along their path  
> All parents are the perfect ones for the daughters and the sons  
> the sins of the past are gone at last  
> and all we miss will return as bliss  
> in the Year of Twenty &lsquo;leven  
> &nbsp;

and if not in 2011, then maybe in 3011.

What did I learn from all this? Aligning syllables, accents and meter is a royal pain!

_Happy New Year!_
