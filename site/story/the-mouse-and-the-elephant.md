&nbsp;Our houses are under attack! &nbsp;Mice. &nbsp;Well, mouse. &nbsp;It's cold, and wet outside. &nbsp;I'd want to keep warm and dry too.

Over at 3 Gunas Lp, Southwick tells me that Roger let the mouse in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&rsquo;s the story that Tommy is telling everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a big deal to Tommy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that he is afraid of them, or particularly worried about the&nbsp;hygiene&nbsp;of these critters.&nbsp; They pretty much follow Tommy&rsquo;s standards. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t pay rent.&nbsp; That would be a big problem for Tommy.&nbsp; Roger didn&rsquo;t hang around to find out, because, well&hellip; it&rsquo;s none of his business.

Tommy laid many traps and baits.&nbsp;&nbsp;He checks them.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gets a rush of happy if one is moved, and has it all in a&nbsp;[CIA dossier][0].&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I say, It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;[big deal to Tommy][1].

Southwick found the mouse stretched out on the kitchen floor when no one was around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this be an opportunity for a prank?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a dollhouse table and chair for the mouse, so that Tommy might see the results of the mouse&rsquo;s last dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Tommy have a sense of the macabre?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s hopin&rsquo;.

So much pompous braggadocio &mdash; there seems to be no room for honest laughter in his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s Southwick&rsquo;s aim, you know, to find the thing that a person needs the most, and help the person get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse, well, it&rsquo;s position in this will be honored &mdash; that&rsquo;s more than it&rsquo;d ever get otherwise.&nbsp;

Todays word from the Muse is brought to you by&nbsp;[The King of Wands][2], The&nbsp;[Queen of Swords][3], and the [Ten of Pentacles][4]. (At this point Kermit shouts: &ldquo;[Ten of Pentacles!&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaay!][5]&rdquo;)

[Thomas Edison][6]&nbsp;is our revered national treasure of creativity. &nbsp;Well earned and well deserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know of his light bulbs and persistence.&nbsp;

But it was more than persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp;He pursued his visions with a steam roller of passion!&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot blooded kill or be killed passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least when it came to&nbsp;[publically torturing elephants][7].&nbsp;&nbsp;He protected his ideas and fought his business enemies with&nbsp;[Atilla the Lawye][8]r.

His enterprise lingers on in modern times: GE a mega corporation that just like Edison&rsquo;s existence: fabulously wealthy, an engine of great worth, but heart and soul? &nbsp;Sorry, that is an after market add-on and voids the warrantee.

Southwick, with his &quot;do unto others as they most deeply need&quot; bullshit, tells me this 10 of pentacles ending leaves us with this: the biggest need our mega-corporations have is pure cup.&nbsp;Compassion for humanity.&nbsp;
