_Wet, Cold, Biting: harsh reality. &nbsp; Maybe why I&rsquo;m writing on exactly the opposite.&nbsp; This is a fictional backstory for something out of the old west. &nbsp;Situations, motivations and facts have been made up (ha, ha, that's fiction.) But I think it will make a good bit of fun to reach the end. &nbsp;And even then, the facts don't fit, that only adds to the fun the_[_anal_][0]_really have with this kind of fiction!_

The Colonel gazed from the lookout tower.&nbsp; He had sent the scout three weeks ago, and was hoping for a speedy return.

An early return would likely mean the operation could proceed.&nbsp; Now was the right time.&nbsp; Delay would simply mean another year at this assignment.&nbsp; The great confrontations might be delayed, but they would happen nevertheless.&nbsp; The Colonel and his wife simply wanted to be assigned to a more civilized location.

Another two weeks passed, and the Colonel began to have concerns for the scout rather than the mission.&nbsp; If the enemy was any farther away, the mission would have to slip to next year: The large force needed to engage the enemy would not have proper supply and the logistics just wouldn&rsquo;t work. &nbsp; &ldquo;Too long, so long.&rdquo; the Colonel muttered to himself about the missed opportunity for early re-assignment.

But now the Colonel was thinking more about the scout.&nbsp; Hard to replace: not many savvy enough for this wilderness.&nbsp; He may have to mount a party to go out and follow the trail markers left by the scout.&nbsp; The Colonel&rsquo;s wife would be _very_ upset, but that&rsquo;s duty. &nbsp;With this scout's reputation, he could not trust any of his men with this assignment.&nbsp; Besides, the Colonel and the scout were the only ones who could interpret their secret trail markers.&nbsp; He would have to lead the party himself.

The young scout was resourceful.&nbsp; Trapping food for survival.&nbsp; Evasion tactics. Local knowledge from the wisest old guard scouts and mentors.&nbsp; Even what bugs might be edible &mdash; especially with a whiskey chaser.

The signs to continue were gone &mdash; too old, erased by the latest sandstorms.&nbsp; Now it involved a slow search of canyons aided by only by intuition.

Three days into the search: a spooked horse, followed by a broken leg.

Enough to screw up the scouts whole day.

The only option? Dig in and wait.&nbsp; The military gears turn slowly, but there would be a search party, and it would likely arrive in about 10 days the scout figured.&nbsp; That much time?&nbsp; &ldquo;I got enough whiskey for that long and can wait with my leg in a splint.&nbsp; If it takes longer, I&rsquo;ll want a drink so bad, I&rsquo;ll just crawl out.&nbsp; Only about 50 miles or so.&rdquo;

The rescue party actually arrived in less than a week: The Colonel included. &nbsp;He had to be there to insure her safety, as he knew he would. &nbsp;The young scout&rsquo;s behavior was outrageous, even for a man.&nbsp; She was considered a filthy whore by most, but she waged a battle disrespect and defiance that was as unique as her gifts as a scout.

Passions in those days were fueled by [lust][1] or [righteousness][2], just as today.&nbsp; The scout polarized people in a way which was entirely unlike her true nature.&nbsp;

Only the Colonel saw her as an essential part of the team and a lady: a woman, and accorded her all the West Point Respect that the military would require he show a General&rsquo;s wife.

Their unique relationship may go down in history.&nbsp;_Or as a fantasy of Old West Mythos, in the true nature of those great exaggerators of the past._
