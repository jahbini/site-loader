I don&rsquo;t think Jug lives in Tommy, OR &mdash; He is a very civilized guy, retired bank teller or something. &nbsp;A real detail person, but very outgoing. &nbsp;

Jug likes to collect recipes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s his main hobby.&nbsp; He has them written on scraps of paper, margins of books, all sorts of places.&nbsp; He actually never thought of putting them on his computer until Jug found a book in the clearance bin.

We have a great little bookstore here in St. Johns.&nbsp; Mankind&rsquo;s greatest invention was the book.&nbsp; Damn straight.

The book was an introduction to computers and had lots of pictures, diagrams and explanations of equipment, connections and, yes, a free DBase II and recipe program.&nbsp; Jug read it cover to cover and finally understood the power of computers for his recipes.&nbsp; He became focussed on obsolete technology.

I mentioned to Jug that he could use his Windows machine to do the same things, but anything more complicated than logging into gmail was way too complicated for Jug.&nbsp; End of conversation.&nbsp; Besides, the book was part of a bunch of boxes, DBase II, DOS, early Windows II (OMG, yes, there WAS a [Windows II][0], it was the Vista of the &lsquo;80s!) &nbsp;Jug does NOT pass up a bargain.

Jug has been on a six month expedition to run his DBase recipe program.&nbsp; He first found an old &rsquo;286 DOS machine at a church bazaar.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very familiar with how both reliability and quirky behavior can be present in old software/hardware combinations. &nbsp; There is an exotic dance to get to these old computer&rsquo;s Nostril of Aphrodite.&nbsp; I have been dancing that dance for years, but Jug just can&rsquo;t dance.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t interested in any part of the dance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just help me with this one tiny step, Jim.&rdquo;

And so Jug has been asking tiny, one step at a time, questions.&nbsp; The questions are always very detailed:&nbsp; Even to the point of coming over to measure ONE voltage on one pin of his &lsquo;puter.&nbsp; Just wanted the voltage.&nbsp; It was easy to do, but when I asked what voltage we were measuring, he said &ldquo;disk power&rdquo; &mdash; I mentioned that we were probing a completely different section of the board, Jug replied that the picture in the book was pretty clear, and even though it was wrong, Jug preferred the book.&nbsp; My explanation required that Jug dance a bit.&nbsp; No go. Even when I mentioned that getting a modern printer to work with these old machines was met with the response:&nbsp; There are plenty of free printers at the Church.

Last week Jug was pretty unhappy.&nbsp; The recipes are piling up.&nbsp; Dammit Jim, I want these recipes.&nbsp; Will you help me get DBase II working or not? &nbsp; I replied that I&rsquo;m happy to provide as much or as little help as Jug needs.&nbsp; A hobby is a hobby.

But last week I asked Jug what was important here. &nbsp;Was it to get his recipes on-line? Or were old-time computers the hobby?&nbsp; Was his mission to Free the DBase Two at the end of chapter 21 the big goal? Jug is at chapter 6 now: one chapter a month is pretty good for an old beast like this, but it&rsquo;s really bad if he wants recipes.&nbsp; He replied that he was able to do it inexpensively because the program was FREE, and the one on the internet was complicated and cost $50.

And then I asked him to add up his time and he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Right.&nbsp; **_Money!_**&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; and then a strange thing happened.&nbsp; Jug stopped for a moment and said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&nbsp; Even if I forget the money, I want it to WORK! My way.&rdquo;

I said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Thats OK.&nbsp; You get to pick your goal and I&rsquo;m happy to help, but you don&rsquo;t seem to be enjoying this.&nbsp; If the payoff from this is only a working recipe program and the expense is your enjoyment of your life, that may not be the balance you want.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like trying to get a small advantage in traffic and getting all steamed up at the loss of some tiny ego-centered goal.&nbsp; It is better to pick goals that give a bigger payoff with less hassle.&nbsp; Work up to more complicated slowly.&rdquo;

Then, Jug said &ldquo;Fuck the DBase Two.&nbsp; Let them rot in their prison.&rdquo;

Today I saw Jug on the street:&nbsp; I said &ldquo;Hi Jug, Howzit!&rdquo;

He said: &ldquo;See, I got a Jug!&nbsp; By the way, I&rsquo;m using that recipe program from the internet. Works fine.&rdquo;

Every time I see him he says &ldquo;got a jug&rdquo; or &ldquo;see, no jug&rdquo; &mdash; He explains that is how he keeps his [Jug-or-Not][1]nickname.&nbsp; I agree, being in control of the nicknames people have for you is a good thing, Yes?.
