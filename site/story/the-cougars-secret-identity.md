The lecture hall is small, maybe 70 seats, but the audience of high-level decision makers is riveted to Thereasa as she speaks.

Her paper, “Demonstration of Control of DNA Augmented Chimerea” is part of NonSaneO’s briefing for a select group of high level officials on “Arachno-Mamalian DNA augmentation.” She finishes her talk in the manner she starts: Riding on the thorax of a Grizzly Bear with 8 legs and the head of a spider.

Her control is unique: She vibes into the energy flows of the giant bug with her hands. Kneading, massaging, humming and kissing, she programs a pattern of behavior into it’s mind. Kind of like changing the kind of web the thing spins.

She says “Web making behavior is so primitive that it is be stored like knitting instructions in the thing’s DNA. By massaging, and stroking, I direct the expression of a single step of action: making a single long thread, or making a spoke of the web. I am able to string these commands together so that the bug seems to have intelligence as it carries out my needs.”

“I reasoned, correctly, that if bees dance to convey messages to other bees in the hive, the more solitary spider would need actual physical contact to get her DNA activations to work. Truly, the commands are only accepted when the mammalian psyche of the chimera is in a near orgasm state. Otherwise, it exerts too much control over the organism’s behavior for reprogramming to be effective.”

Thereasa’s gifts of her charismatic presence, intense emotion, inquiring intellect, hands of genius and ability to kiss ookie giant bugs on their weird bug-eyes makes her a unique asset to NonSaneO’s program.

Thereasa answers the questions that she knew would come: “Ms. Qugaré, can you teach your techniques?”

“Yes, of course, I can teach — are you ready to learn?” The congressman quickly lowers his hand. “We lack volunteers to take on this task. I am in the early stages of training one subject: Here is a video of Steven commanding the bat-spinners to perform useful work in hazardous environments.”

The video shows a man with two bat-spinners: he is waving his fingers mysteriously as the bats spin webs around a cake box: finally they fly straight up, each pulling on a thread of spider silk and finally hang it on a tree branch several hundred feet above ground.

“Note that each of these bat-spinners is attached with a web strand to Steven’s hand. Steven is able to control each movement explicitly. Unfortunately, the bat-spinners need constant stimulus. Foreplay, if you will, and Steven often rushes through that.” She speaks with a bit of matter-of-fact realization that Steven would never really “get it.”

Thereasa Qugaré finishes her talk with the usual request for more funding for more research, but secretly she is quite happy with the current state of NonSaneToe’s decision makers. They want to create the perfect worker, but are too scared to let the secret of these horrors out of the lab. So far, Thereasa is the only human that can control the things.

At the luncheon afterwards, she catches the eye of a Federal Judge. She enjoys the flirt and thinks that more friends in high places is a good thing. “Do you know Justice {{{First Name}}} Bender?” she asks. “Yes, as a matter of fact, {{{fbgender}}} spoke of you in rather positive terms.” I’ll bet, she thinks.

Just as she is ready to make an evening connection, her phone rings: “This is Detective Tamworth of the Portland Police Department. Am I speaking with Thereasa Koogray?”

Thereasa — “Yes. This is Thereasa Qugaré. What is this about?”

Tamworth — “A Mr Steven Boitoi has been reported missing, and we would like to speak with you.” Thereasa’s blood turns cold. Something happened to Steven. All her spinners back at her treetop ranch in Forest Park would get loose!

“I am at a conference in Chicago, I will return immediately and speak with you Monday. Yes, 10AM.”
