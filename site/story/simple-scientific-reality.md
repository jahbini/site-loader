 I had another dentist appointment.&nbsp; It took about two hours for them to find the right anasthetic.&nbsp; As the third round of injections kicked in I had enough time to read the National Scientific magazine.&nbsp; In there it mentioned that Science now believes [time is an illusion][0].

Ha, They Indian mystics have been pushing that [reality is illusion][1] crap for centuries:&nbsp; Is that all you got Mr. Science?&nbsp; (Science now believes? -- Can a non-human believe? Doesn't [make any sense][2], but we swallow it anyway.)

&nbsp;

No, for science to be science, it has to be duplicatable.&nbsp; So, Mr. Science, duplicate space and time.&nbsp; Not simulate. (Can an author talk to a mythical Mr. Science?&nbsp; Doesn't make any sense, but we swallow it anyway.)

&nbsp;

So reality is an illusion after all.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Thank goodness. &nbsp;_And we paid these guys all these centuries for this?_&nbsp; And then the anesthetic kicked in and the pain became an illusion, too. Thank goodness.

&nbsp;

I'm at the James John Cafe as I write this, and they just handed me my chops.&nbsp; Dad-GumIt!&nbsp; {{{First Name}}}, I come here today as a flaming pillar of creativity, and I can't concentrate on the writing when the food is this good.&nbsp; Grrr. &nbsp; Suzanne countered (It's her counter): &quot;there would be NO writing at all without the great vittles, and Jim, you should be dad-gum grateful to even get inside a secret location like this.&quot;

&nbsp;

I'm getting together another grub-stake expedition up the entrepreneurial rivers of technology.&nbsp; Thar's gold in them thar&nbsp; business opportunities.&nbsp; Biz-ops. Over at the Tropic of Oregon they have grow-ops.&nbsp; I look for push-ops.

&nbsp;

Push-ops.&nbsp; I push the buttons now, and the buttons I push make a 'puter do something fun, interesting or useful far into the future: at the push of a button.&nbsp; That's what programmers do.&nbsp; It takes months and an 18 hour a day meditative concentration that's akin to zen chess. &nbsp;Makes me want to go &quot;Yeee-Haaa&quot;.&nbsp; Just like a portrait painter, tell me what you want the machine to do, and I'll write the program. On time, under budget and outperforming the specifications.&nbsp; Web applications. No smaller projects than 6 man-months.&nbsp; Just don't expect me to pay attention to anything else.

&nbsp;

And what would I be missing in my gone-a-zen state?&nbsp; I'd be missing out on some exciting stuff over at the North End Galleries: an underground pool-table of energy bouncing around in worker chaos lines, all choreographed to come together this weekend (Oct 16, 2010).&nbsp; Show, Art, Music, Drama, Studios, Blessings and likely, Cursings.

I tackled one of the chaosographers: Orion, surprisingly beltless and earthbound, and asked him for the facts: &quot;[what are the facts, just the facts, sir][3].&quot; &nbsp;He said: &quot;Doors open @ 1:00 P.M. Music starts at 2:00 12 bands All Ages Local heroes - Likity, Cheap Meats, Teflon, and Mannaquin Head! $3.00&quot; -- He disavous any reports of half-pipes, or any pipes at all.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Stuff for the young,&nbsp; Stuff for the trendy, Stuff to get St. John's Moving! &nbsp;That's the hope.

&nbsp;

Now lissen up, {{{First Name}}}, I have basically getting disbelief from my readers about, well, basically, the Three Wise Men over at Gunas Lp -- Let me inform youse guys:

&nbsp;

Tommy is professor of ethics at Waterfront University.&nbsp; He has a specialty in Public Speaking and holds the coveted &quot;mouthpiece&quot; chair.

&nbsp;

Roger has a Ph.D. in Preventative Maintenance and teaches on-line at &quot;Safety First&quot; University.&nbsp; Roger says: &quot;Safety First is it's own middle name.&quot; He is working on-line for a second Ph.D in _Minding Your Own Fucking Business_.

&nbsp;

Southwick has a M.A. in Yoo-Hoo Koo-Koo from Sewage Newage University.&nbsp; Southwick says: &quot;I see archetypes...&nbsp; Everywhere.&quot;
