&nbsp;We are running into scary season.&nbsp;&nbsp;Halloween?&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Spiders for Jesus?&nbsp;&nbsp;Icky stuff at the bottom of the pipe?&nbsp;&nbsp;NO, dad gum it, Elections!&nbsp;&nbsp;The time we have to choose the person to screw us: Sophie had it easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's scary.

&nbsp;

Elections are scary, but once in a while, we voters are actually asked an IMPORTANT question.

&nbsp;

Yippee: I get to vote on something important.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's&nbsp;the Medical Dispensary thing: [Prop 74][0].&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes one more step against the Mega-Corporate &quot;War on People&quot; attitudes of the last few generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Prop 74][0] simply allows for a dispensary system for patients who need medical access to Green Elephant Horn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple.

&nbsp;

Unavoidable, actually.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system is incomplete, and does not fulfill the intent of Oregon's Medical laws: Patients need humane treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Elephant Horn is accepted as humane medical treatment, and should not be withheld.&nbsp;&nbsp;Done deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm voting for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;My wrists and joints thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;The belly laugh factory thanks you, too.

&nbsp;

I'm writing this from deep inside the Green Elephant compound at the Tropic of Oregon's resort here in St. John's-- I talked to the Rugged Old Dog In Charge: The _RODIC_, it's an old military term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Zuul][1] has scars of multiple injuries, and if he complained of a few muscle spasms, I'd be the first to believe him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zuul explains it as simple logistics: somebody's got to do it.

&nbsp;

Zuul also explains that serious research and taxonomic studies categorize the benefits of various breeds and processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask: &quot;Zuul, is that funny?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a serious Ingesticative Journalist&nbsp;looking for a joke here.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zuul looks me in the eye and says: &quot;Shit, I ain't the famous writer, you come up with the fucking joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the way, we don't serve no amoebas here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't get cards, you know.&quot;

&nbsp;

I'm glad to know that the Tropic of Oregon is 100% behind the City Council's insistence that St. Johns is an &quot;Amoeba Free Zone.&quot;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I look around, among the aloha shirts and elephant harnesses, i notice that there is an underlying logic to the strategies of the Tropic of Oregon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research, duplicatable taxonomic studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic and reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, crap, I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope they can keep logic and reason out of the election.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections run on crazy energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanity has as much chance as Jon Stewart to keep Colbert sane.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read that closely, it doesn't make sense, but it does.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the power of election season insanity.

&nbsp;

### So just keep repeating, &quot;It's only an election, It's only an election, It's only an election&quot;
