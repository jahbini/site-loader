Tommy is a master&nbsp;[magician][0]. &nbsp;He deceives and you believe.&nbsp; And that makes it true.&nbsp; And so it isn&rsquo;t a deception.&nbsp; Until sometime later, maybe never. and then?&nbsp; _Who Gives a Fuck._

That&rsquo;s Tommy&rsquo;s Church, you know, the Church of WGAF, the official church of Tommy County, OR: they pray that way alot. It must be a Church: beliefs, tithes, sermons &mdash; Southwick has attended a lot of these sermons recently in his quest for 100% spirituality: Truly understanding the spirituality of the unspiritual, from a spiritual level, you know, not a judgmental one. &nbsp; St. John&rsquo;s Jim respects [all churches][1].

But the person who believes in magic is also easily taken in by magic.&nbsp; Especially if he thinks it is in his favor to believe &mdash; Even the simplest of tricks seduces Tommy if hits his lower chakras, the true loves in his life.

Watch him as he mixes the &ldquo;Reality&quot; show Kool-Aid made of steroid pumped nasties of our culture, and he believes 100%. &nbsp;Shows like _True Cops_, _10,000 Rapists_, and of course, _Nostradomas Distracts_. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s real.&nbsp; Kind of like when my cousin, at 4, said &ldquo;[Mighty Mouse][2] is real. They even took a picture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tommy believes like that.&nbsp; My cousin, Monty, is now 59, and he, like many back home, still believes &hellip;&nbsp; in Mighty Mouse.

That&rsquo;s the strength of Tommy&rsquo;s belief in the Magician.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the strength of the Magician in Tommy.

Tonight Tommy is mesmerized by the claims the TV is making about an &lsquo;evil doer&rsquo; playing up lurid details just for viewer appeal.&nbsp; Slightly more true than &ldquo;True Detective&rdquo;.&nbsp; Tommy, OR is a far realer place than TV, Tommy.&nbsp; Southwick is sure the &ldquo;wisdom is out there,&rdquo; and not on TV.

Southwick expresses doubt in the sincerity of a supposed &ldquo;witness&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; Tommy jumps in to support the confabulation.

Southwick points to the screen and says &ldquo;most of what we see is made up.&rdquo;

Tommy counters, &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t see all of it.&rdquo; &mdash; Southwick points to the screen and says &ldquo;most of what we see is made up.&rdquo;

Tommy evades and offers up more Kool-Aid, but Southwick keeps hurling his psychic power ball: Pointing to the _Power-Fart Ad_ now showing on Tommy&rsquo;s ego sized HDTV, and saying &ldquo;most of what we see is made up&rdquo;

And finally Tommy acknowledges that the [layers of interpretation of reality are not real][3], but dumped on us by fantasy, society, culture or stupid peer pressure.&nbsp; And Tommy, in solemn prayer says, &ldquo;Yeah, Who Gives A Fuck&rdquo;

And [Hari Hari][4] right back at you, Tommy, carry joy:&nbsp; Southwick will sleep easy tonight.&nbsp; Tommy will wake for a 5AM visit to the WGAF nunnery and return for morning service. &nbsp;Unless she accepts TommyCard, she might be disappointed. &nbsp;

Tommy, you are still a master [magician][0]. As the Great Ones remind us: &nbsp;[Be Excellent to each other, and Party On, Dudes][5].
