<p >Tomorrow is thanksgiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes today is like Mardi-Gras for a miser.&nbsp; Tomorrow the miser must be &ldquo;thankful&rdquo; and oh, so giving. &nbsp;Last opportunity to be stingy.</p>

<p >Hey, [First Name], honestly, I&rsquo;m struggling hard with what I got.&nbsp; I work when I can, and it&rsquo;s damned good money, but times are tough, contract offers are pro bono, no pay, equity only, projects that just cant work.</p>

<p >Honest: One says: &quot;My site's been hacked.&quot; &nbsp;I say &quot;Yes, I found the hack, fixed it. &nbsp;You need to clean the site up. It's got holes everywhere.&quot; &nbsp;-- He says: &quot;We can't do that, the site might go down&quot; &nbsp;-- I reply: &quot;Yes, of course, sir, my mission in life is to Ransack your Roman Empire. &nbsp;You have found me out.&quot;</p>

<p >Worse than worst.&nbsp; I gotta be very careful with every penny, and I just lost my cell phone (I hate that, I have to learn a new crappy cellphone interface), and something ALWAYS pops up!</p>

<p >So today, buddy, I&rsquo;m keeping it all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got some schemes to keep my cash flow to the bare minimum and if they don&rsquo;t work,&nbsp; well, I&rsquo;ll just think of something new. &nbsp;<strong><em>Excuse me</em></strong>, [First Name], as I spend my money on me, or nothing!</p>

<p >But, even as I write the previous paragraph, realizing it&rsquo;s truth and yes, it is true, I notice that I&rsquo;m kicking away feelings, connections, hope, what a waste of wisdom for a truth. &nbsp;Never sacrifice wisdom for the merely true.</p>

<p >The wisdom of the bigger picture is this: &nbsp;<em>I have castles yet to build!</em>&nbsp; The real source of value is the sea of human energy.&nbsp; And fishing in that sea means fishing in a sea of feelings, connections and hope.&nbsp; Best not to kick over those cups.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t change my economic situation at all, just how I think about it.</p>

<p >Getting those cups to work is not a once a year thing.&nbsp; Maybe Thanksgiving isn&rsquo;t just the day after Miser&rsquo;s Day&hellip; &nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

<p >Today is is not tomorrow, it's Miser&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp; Pretend you are a miser for a moment: think about what things you hold too tightly and what that might mean for you. &nbsp;Just for today.</p>

<p >Today&rsquo;s story is based on the destination <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/five-of-cups/">5 of Cups</a> (wasted emotions, regret, disconnect )</p>
<p >and the motifs: <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/four-of-pentacles/">4 of Pentacles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/seven-of-wands/">7 of wands</a>: the miser guarding with dreams and schemes.</p>
<p>Hey, This one was too easy, and too obvious.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t me, I drew the three cards fair and square.&nbsp; The Tarot made me do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Miser&rsquo;s Day!</p>
