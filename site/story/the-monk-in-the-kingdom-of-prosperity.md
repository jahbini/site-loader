The muse popped out of my Tarot deck screaming Get Strength from The King of Pentacles and The Hermit. &nbsp;_Hey, that really was the draw, I'm helpless when the Tarot speaks. &nbsp;The Tarot make me do it._

-----------------&nbsp;

(The authors, Tommy, and Southwick discuss this work of &quot;fiction&quot; in this&nbsp;writer's interview cut -- Their commentary is in parentheses)

The old monk wandered through the country and as the fates would have it, became known as a man of Wisdom.&nbsp; One day he was passing through a small but prosperous kingdom.

The king invited the wise monk saying: &ldquo;I have a vexing problem.&nbsp; My honor, the honor of the queen, and war may be looming. &nbsp;My queen has been accused and Lord Vaso tells me the prisoner is here to give evidence.&rdquo;

(Tommy says: &quot;Vexing? &nbsp;What the? &nbsp;Are you lame, nobody down at the docks knows what the crap you mean by vexing. &nbsp;It's some sort of ladies word for a wrench, isn't it? &nbsp;Southwick: It's a puzzle.)

The monk said &ldquo;let us all see.&rdquo;

After the prisoner speaks, the evidence seems damning enough.&nbsp; The queen&rsquo;s life is suspended by a hair, and Lord Vaso will have his war.

The queen blanches and the prisoner says: &ldquo;Forgive me my lady.&rdquo;

(Tommy: &quot;This was my idea -- Not to let the reader know what the prisoner said. &nbsp;Freaks 'em out.&quot; &nbsp;Southwick: &quot;Yes, you can really freak people out.)

The King is furious, and Lord Vaso savors his moment.

The Monk speaks up: &ldquo;Have you no mercy, this man is in pain.&rdquo;

The King gives the signal to dispatch the prisoner as humanely as the times allow.

The Monk speaks up:&rdquo;Hold, one moment, let me ask the prisoner one fact, and then may I send this poor man to his reward.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king assents.

(Southwick says: &quot;This is the part I thought up&quot; -- Tommy replies: &quot;Yeah, play on their sympathy to get to power. &nbsp;Always works.)&nbsp;

The Monk looks at the prisoner and says: &ldquo;Did not Lord Vaso threaten your daughters with torture? Did he not tell you to say that? Is the queen blameless?&rdquo;

Even in his pain, the prisoner knows where his true allegiance lies: &ldquo;Yes, she is blameless: Lord Vaso forced me.&rdquo; &mdash; A glance from the Monk and the prisoner is forever silent.

(Tommy says: &quot;Bingo, the trap is sprung! &nbsp;Hot Damn.&quot; &nbsp;Southwick replies: &quot;Yes, just like we saw on the Childrens Trauma Workshop on TV&quot;)

Lord Vaso is shocked at the turn, and&nbsp;without his witness, is powerless.

The Monk looks across to Lord Vaso: &ldquo;You would torture children to get servants to lie, so you can start your war with the Queen&rsquo;s home. This whole family is now wholly dependent on the queen, in addition to replacing her servant.&nbsp; The blood of this man&rsquo;s family is now on your hands.&rdquo;

The Monk suggests that Lord Vaso forfeit an eighth of his estate so the queen may take care of her new adopted family. &nbsp;Lord Vaso looks hard at the Monk.

As the party walks back from the guardhouse, the Monk says: &ldquo;Prosperity demands stability.&nbsp; Do you not agree that stability is better than war?&rdquo;&nbsp; The King and Queen agree,&rdquo;you are truly wise.&rdquo; &nbsp; The Monk says: &ldquo;It is a good thing to find any path to stability during times of chaos.&nbsp; I may not always be so wise as this night.&nbsp; I will endeavor to help Lord Vaso learn the value of stability&rdquo;

(Southwick finishes: &quot;We wanted to keep Lord Vaso's and the Queen's real involvement secret, because it really does not make any difference if stability is preserved. &nbsp;And that part of the ending was Tommy's idea -- It keeps the option open to have a sequel&quot; &nbsp;Tommy replies: &quot;Yeah, Am I Smart or what? And next time come up with something better than _'you are truly wise' --_That's just lame&quot; )
