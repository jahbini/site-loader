<p>Hurricane Visionary demolished my fortress of solitude today.&nbsp; It is slowly being re-built.&nbsp; Visionary, it seems, is planning a whopping art show in a few days at the North End Gallery.&nbsp; He descended onto stage cool-zero with sweeping glances into the very corners of the hall. &nbsp;Nothing escaped his glance and inclusion into a grand plan: &nbsp;A true&nbsp;<span ><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresario">impresario</a></span>.&nbsp; Planning what will be a great production.&nbsp; I have been blessed. &nbsp; Be there!&nbsp;</p>
<p >And now silence has re-entered the fortress &mdash; We may begin:</p>

<p >Bar Bets:&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the thing about bar bets.&nbsp; They are conversation starters.&nbsp; You are supposed to pay for the conversation.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what a bar bet is all about.&nbsp; So when I went to the Palate of Plew&rsquo;s Brews and saw a micro-brew with the work &lsquo;merkin&rsquo; in the name, I knew I had struck &lsquo;bar bet&rsquo; heaven.&nbsp; A merkin is a pretty odd and disgusting thing.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of a reason why someone would ever need a wig for pubic hair.</p>

<p >Me: I&rsquo;ll bet that no one here knows what the word &lsquo;merkin&rsquo; means.&nbsp; Buy me a beer and I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>

<p >Them:&nbsp; Oh, no&hellip; Let&rsquo;s look it up on the internet. &nbsp;There's a hurricane a-brewin with our appetite for information.</p>

<p >All the cell phones come out, Great God Google downsizes Jim&rsquo;s once in a lifetime bar-bet and 30 seconds later:&nbsp; They all groan: &ldquo;Yuch, that&rsquo;s disgusting&rdquo;</p>

<p >Now everybody in the bar is now chatting amiably about the fact that merkin refers to a wig for pubic hair.&nbsp; Ha ha.&nbsp; I am not sure about the wisdom of having a brew called &lsquo;merkin&rsquo;, but it gives you the opportunity to say &ldquo;Gimme a firkin of merkin&rdquo; which would be a cask of 72 pints of the brew.</p>

<p >The upshot of this?&nbsp; [First Name], if you and I met more often here, they&rsquo;d have a nicer clientele.&nbsp; Show me your best bar bet, OK?</p>

<p >I have just been handed a Late Breaking Flash! &nbsp; The <a target="_blank" href="http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Satvik">Satvik</a> Angel&rsquo;s are coming to nest at the <a target="_blank" href="http://nwresourcecenter.com/">NW Resource Center</a> on Lombard: They are announcing &ldquo;Free at Three&rdquo; &mdash; Every Friday at 3PM till it&rsquo;s gone, these angels will have delicious, nourishing home cooked free food for anyone.</p>

<p >Just remember these words: Everyone.&nbsp; Free at Three.&nbsp; Friday. <a target="_blank" href="http://nwresourcecenter.com/">Resource Center</a>.</p>
<p >Why? Why! There's a Hurricane a-brewin' and these Earth Angels are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.library.yale.edu/~llicense/forcegen.shtml">Major</a>!</p>
