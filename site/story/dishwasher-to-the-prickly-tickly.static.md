<p>Veterans Day, 2010:&nbsp; Mark your calendars &mdash; this is the day the Portland starts wearing longjohns 24/7 &mdash; Whizzing has just gotten astronomically more difficult.</p>
<p >Veterans Day, a holiday.&nbsp; I celebrate with a walk over to Pier Park to enjoy a sweet steam breath PNW morning.&nbsp; The big evergreens are having discussions high above: you don&rsquo;t think they talk to each other with their trunks do you?&nbsp; No, Their lofty discussions are echoed in bird calls and rustling branches. They keep their discussions on a high level.</p>

<p ><img alt="Strange Playground?" align="left" src="http://stjohnsjim.com/assets/images/PlayCups.jpg" />Down on the ground some of the playground stuff puzzles me: are these bowls for puking after spinning in the swings?&nbsp; Some sort of high tech tin-can telephone? &nbsp;Some sort of chair?</p>

<p >Take your babies to the park.&nbsp; Maybe they can figure out those wierd cuppy things.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s too much fun letting my imagination run wild.</p>

<p >But as I walk through the neighborhoods, I see the threadbare trees with prickly tickly tops.&nbsp; And my thoughts shift to the babies of the Kings.</p>

<p >We all have babies of one sort or another.&nbsp; They all require care to grow strong and worthy. &nbsp;Real babies, yes, but also your goals, enterprises and dreams.&nbsp; Even Throntle has the dream of getting off the needle.&nbsp; At present, it&rsquo;s a miscarriage, but we can always hope.</p>

<p >Bringing a dream to life in November is hard: not like Thanksgiving day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more like the prickly tickly events and reactions we share with the prickly tickly trees.</p>

<p >The Kings of Lombard have their shop-kingdom babies in various stages of life:&nbsp; The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/96683394@N00/350036756/">James John Cafe</a>&nbsp;is mature and well cared for.&nbsp; Same for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGAYk5VWkTw">Slim&rsquo;s</a>.&nbsp; The Hope for Health may be a senile old business, but it is a well deserved senility.</p>

<p >Some shops are truly babies, showing lots of growing pains instead of giggles and smiles.&nbsp; How can I tell?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my secret: I wash dishes.</p>

<p >Like Southwick, my first job was dishwasher in a chinese restaurant.&nbsp; As long as people prefer to eat off of ceramic, it will be a hard job to outsource.</p>

<p >[First Name], Southwick gave me his stake-out report from his dish washing concession at the food carts. &nbsp;It seems there is a new Storage biz there (Very profitable -- hey, you gotta store the crud you get at the <i>mall</i>, especially after you get <i>evicted</i>.) &nbsp;Southwick saw Tommy renting storage for hordes of amoeba! He's stockpiling them, Southwick says. &nbsp;We will see.</p>

<p >Southwick also tells me that when he visits friends he will often volunteer as dishwasher.&nbsp; He gets into a flow.&nbsp; Turns on his worker energy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s humble, but your hands are always getting clean and warm.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s important on a PNW evening at a friend&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p >There is a bit of fun for the careful observer, too.&nbsp; From simple stuff like &ldquo;Hmm. people aren&rsquo;t eating the horse hoof salad tonight&rdquo; to &ldquo;Hmmm. &lsquo;Suzy heart Joe&rsquo; finger painted in gravy.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a while the hints can build up and you know that [First Name] is reading this right now, also why Mothra and Godzilla are fighting again, when outwardly they seem A-OK.&nbsp; &mdash; You find out a lot by cleaning trash up.</p>

<p >So when the personal interactions seem like the Gulf Oil Spill of emotions, a cleaning is in order.&nbsp;While we are not exactly washing ceramic plates, you get the idea.&nbsp;Kind of like cleaning a horse. Start at the top.&nbsp; Work down.</p>

<p >With a single person, you start with the very big values, the ones that trip the highest Thanksgiving <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com">Bliss</a> states and work back down from there.</p>

<p >With people on a team, you simply start at the top with the highest commonly shared Thanksgiving goals of the team.&nbsp; Things they all agree about.&nbsp; Then you work down to details carefully and slowly honoring all participants.</p>

<p >It works best when the emotions are clean and clear, but you do what you can.&nbsp; Cloudy emotions are not bad, just inefficient as they make our vision of goals and roles less clear and less obtainable.&nbsp; If you want to obtain success, you may want to take out the mental trash.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not just for <em>spirituality</em> &mdash; it&rsquo;s simply practical.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I call this <a target="_blank" href="http://celarien.com">Celarien</a> stuff &ldquo;Practical Spirituality.&rdquo; &nbsp;Personally, I&rsquo;m into the NLP for my own spiritual quest: That&rsquo;s the Old Testament Prophet stuff, in case you were wondering.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not all NLP does well.</p>

<p >It&rsquo;s like washing dishes.&nbsp; Some of it cleans up easily, and some of it requires a bit of time to soak before you get to the squeaky clean of better judgement.&nbsp; And, like a shower, you may want to do it more than once.</p>
