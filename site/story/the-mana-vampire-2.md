&nbsp; So I'm walking with my friend,&nbsp;[Enkidu][0]&nbsp;on Lombard Ave one evening in St. Johns. We pause to cross a street, and Humbaba walks up and says: &quot;I can't believe that Tomorrow is the ST JOHN'S PARADE!&quot; Then I said: &quot;And day after that, I can't believe I'll wait a whole year for the next one.&quot; Then he said something quite significant: &quot;For the last three years I've had my&nbsp;_childhood dream_&nbsp;fulfilled... I've been in each St. John's parade&quot; --- Some dream...

After a few more rounds of this, I stopped on the sidewalk and started walking in the other direction, crossing the street.&nbsp;[Enkidu][0]&nbsp;was totally mystified: What are you Doing?? -- I told him that they guy was a &quot;[Mana][1]&nbsp;Vampire&quot; -- A person who will hijack your time, your privacy, your emotions in exchange for making you hours older and very bored.&nbsp;[Enkidu][0]&nbsp;said, but if I act friendly, in a few weeks I might get a hit off a bong from the guy.

And then I said: would you get your self out-of-tune with your thoughts just so you could talk with a Mana Vampire for even MORE time? And&nbsp;[Enkidu][0]&nbsp;replied, &quot;No, I'd just bail right then.&quot;

Jim - &quot;So you'd cut him off just like me, except you'd wait to take his grass under the guise of friendship?&quot;

[Enkidu][0]&nbsp;- &quot;Well, yes...&quot;

Jim - I'd rather not squander my time, energy and emotions on the iffy payoff of a couple of hits. Kind of like tricking him. Not my style. I don't want to give my Mana away. 

A few minutes later&nbsp;[Enkidu][0]&nbsp;exclaims in a stunned voice: &quot;I get it, these people suck your energy: I can count lots of people who do that! I gotta cut that out!&quot;

{{{First Name}}}, I love epiphanies. It's my passion.
