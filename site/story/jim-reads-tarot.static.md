<p>Free -- Just keep reading. &nbsp;Chaos time.&nbsp; crap.&nbsp; The James John Cafe is closed this week. &nbsp; Throws every damn thing off.&nbsp; If I control the chaos, then it&rsquo;s no longer chaos.&nbsp; And believe me, I can&rsquo;t control the requirements of the JJC to take their well deserved holiday, nor the butterfly effect consequences.</p>

<p >I find the Falafel Plate at <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=14214202442705621592&amp;q=maps+slim's+bar&amp;gl=us">Slim&rsquo;s</a> mysteriously satisfying, but the fountain of writer&rsquo;s mana here needs serious repair.&nbsp; Trickier than a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stutz_Bearcat">Stutz-Bearcat</a> carburator with dual USB ports, these fountains of writer&rsquo;s mojo are notoriously finiky. (This is writer&rsquo;s block remediation: write about the block. And let me tell you It may work &mdash; The Mind numbing TV commercials are set to go off every 7 minutes.&nbsp; 7 minutes of clarity at a time.&nbsp; It could work.)</p>

<p >I have to apologize to Sarrah&nbsp;Verdier for not giving her credit for the very fun artwork of Sandy's Halloween Dream. &nbsp;Sarrah is one of the very creative folk at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cornerindustries.com/">North End Gallery</a>.<img alt="The Cougar fights the Boss Grizzly Spinner" align="left" src="http://stjohnsjim.com/bridgefight1.gif" /></p>

<p >On another note, I&rsquo;m starting to give <span ><em>Tarot Readings!</em></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Free.&nbsp; To you.&nbsp; [First Name], I&rsquo;ll give you a free Tarot reading here in St. John&rsquo;s just for reading these e-mail stories.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my way of saying thank-you for helping me improve my writing.</p>

<p >The City Council reminds me that St. John&rsquo;s is an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vpDVqYqRvrs/SxFetaK2QAI/AAAAAAAAAyE/zeBGmmBx_Gw/s1600/070813_cartoon_7_contest_p465.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http://quehacecjw.blogspot.com/2009/11/amigas-with-amoebas.html&amp;h=340&amp;w=465&amp;sz=97&amp;tbnid=GTcQfn6x_ZSLbM:&amp;tbnh=94&amp;tbnw=128&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Damoeba%2Bcartoon&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=amoeba+cartoon&amp;usg=__xYTw4ap3uR0cPpY1sXOWgH_mrl8=&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=59jRTNHzM4yosAP4vqnFCw&amp;ved=0CCMQ9QEwBg">amoeba</a> free city.&nbsp; Unlike the rest of Portland who have not taken a position on this important topic.&nbsp; The City Council will go to any length to find a significant benefit that St. John&rsquo;s offers for residents and businesses.&nbsp; There have been mumblings about the Food Carts over by the Crystal Fixin Hookah drive-through.&nbsp; Mumblings about amoebas with strong arm tactics.&nbsp; I think those mumblings are just a bunch of made up hooey, but I&rsquo;ll be following this story this month.&nbsp; Keep an eye out.&nbsp; Er. Open.</p>
