<p>(Author's note: &nbsp;This one is more imagery than narrative. &nbsp;A friend asked if I could add one more dimension to the writing, and well, this is my response. &nbsp;The narrative was bent. &nbsp; Sometimes that happens. As a result, the relationships between paragraphs is less structured, I hope you enjoy.)</p>
<p>It's all scientific. &nbsp;Science tells us: on one&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/bpa-found-on-receipts-and_n_794067.html">hand</a>, and on the other&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/surgeon-general-1-cigaret_n_794250.html">hand</a>. &nbsp;I give up. Are the end times coming? &nbsp;End of crappy reports like those two, I hope.</p>
<p>But science does know lots of stuff:&nbsp; Like the fact that both aromas and earthquakes activate our most primitive neural responses:&nbsp; A newborn is hugely sensitive to falling; and smells, for some mysterious reason, are wired directly to the brain's &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/limbicsystem.html">Big Gadget.</a>&rdquo; &nbsp;In real terms: they have mojo powers.</p>
<p >Yesterday, I mentioned that the Tarot King/Queen has nothing to do with man-woman.&nbsp; Well, yes, of course it does. &nbsp;Think of shifting the view from &quot;functional&quot; to &quot;relational.&quot;</p>

<p >Every sideshow carney knows the Tarot is THE reference book for the most important question: &ldquo;Is he the one for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a shift in perspective, but still sees the same archetype.&nbsp; The Queen becomes &ldquo;First Citizen&rdquo; of the domain &mdash; someone else is the king.</p>

<p >For example: The Queen of Swords.&nbsp; If a woman is married to a military guy and supports her husband&rsquo;s military values for herself and her children, then clearly she is the &ldquo;first citizen&rdquo; and Queen of the domain.</p>

<p >But shift your view slightly:&nbsp; Same military guy, but the woman is dedicated to science and raises the family that way.&nbsp; Her husband&rsquo;s Military influence (his domain) is augmented or replaced by her values. &nbsp;She is more like the King of Wands, than a Queen of Swords.&nbsp;</p>

<p >(Jim's note: Are you asleep yet? &nbsp;Sorry, but some of my readers tell me I need dot all my &quot;hermits&quot; and cross all my &quot;kings&quot;. -- I don't think there is any wisdom whatsoever in crossing a king. &nbsp;Dotted hermits are a dime a dozen. )</p>

<p >It is OK to shift points of view temporarily, and surprisingly often, permanently.&nbsp; For example, temperature makes a huge difference in flavor: warm, cold and ice &mdash; You might like warm cream, and <i><b>love</b></i> ice cream but you <i><b>hate</b></i> cold cream. &nbsp;The emotional reactions we might have depend on whether we taste with our minds, gut, skin or &quot;yuk yuks&quot;.</p>

<p >But enough of the Tarot -- &nbsp;Business in St. John&rsquo;s is, for the moment, tasting a bit like cold cream. &nbsp;Store walls are bare where a thriving business should be &mdash; or at least a wall mounting, maybe of an egyptian sun god.</p>

<p >Even worse -- In line with the spirit of giving is the spirit of taking. &nbsp; Christmas tree lots are shrinking, shrinking shrinking from 3AM theft.&nbsp; It seems like the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mappsd.org/tweakers.htm">tweakers</a>&nbsp;are having Christmas early, or else the black market in Christmas trees (Are we still allowed to say Christmas? Are we still allowed to say Obama?) is vast.</p>

<p ><span >From some of the conversations and complaining I hear, some people don&rsquo;t get the emotional content of what&rsquo;s happening around them:&nbsp; Especially when folks are stuck at the neener-neener response stage.</span></p>
<p ><span >Do they think emotional cold cream should be just like emotional ice cream? &nbsp;One might be just for learning and the other for enjoying.&nbsp; Or maybe enjoying in completely different ways?</span></p>

<p >Southwick is looking to add skills to his <a target="_blank" href="http://current.com/news/92847649_obama-threatens-our-rights-and-free-speech-progressives-celebrate.htm?xid=76&amp;#92860476">resume</a>.&nbsp;Tommy told him to hang at he dumpster behind the Wal-mart and jump in any pick-up truck that had less than 8 guys in it. &nbsp;Construction work. Tommy told him to bring his own sawdust to scatter around at the end of the shift.&nbsp; The diversion worked well, for the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p >Tommy was bragging about his exploits and compared himself to the guy in &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_of_a_Woman">Scent of a Woman</a>&rdquo; where DeNiro&rsquo;s character wants to leave this life as he entered it: &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bartleby.com/100/337.128.html">Trailing Clouds of Glory</a>&rdquo; &mdash; Hence, the victorious Scent of a Woman. (Elitists note: the grand exit -- don't sign the contract without it!)</p>

<p >Roger says he leaves his lady in the morning with a lingering kiss and a hand visiting an intimate friend (Southwick admits the actual word Roger used was &quot;hootchie.&quot;) &nbsp;As he drives away the lingering moment becomes a lingering scent.&nbsp; Later, a slow warm exhale on a cold finger releases vivid memories of recent jousts and earthquakes.</p>

<p >Roger says: &nbsp;&ldquo;Helped me through many boring meetings.&nbsp; Makes me wanna repeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p >Tommy cut in &ldquo;Gotta have push ups, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p >Southwick asked: &ldquo;Do you do the push-ups, or does she?&rdquo;</p>

<p >Tommy replied: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do the midnight push-ups unless you do your regular push-ups.&rdquo;</p>

<p >Southwick replied: &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer my question.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p >That&rsquo;s nice.&nbsp; I guess, from her perspective, she <i>might</i> think of it as a way to keep <i>her</i> on <i>his</i> mind all day long.&nbsp; Fresh, organic, wholesome emotional ice cream with added adhesive power: an Oregon natural.</p>

<p >A sure way to keep aromas, tastes and earthquakes in mind.</p>
