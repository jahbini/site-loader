<p>The trick or treat parade of last week reminded me of this academic trick or treat:</p>
<p>I've been thinking about starting back my class-load at an on-line university.&nbsp; I teach web technology via the internet.&nbsp; Fabulous.&nbsp; We are just learning how to do that, and the technology is improving daily.&nbsp; Still, it has defects of it's own, as well as the defects in any educational system.&nbsp; One defect is a real pain for me.</p>

<p >By far, It's the least fun I can imagine having while teaching.</p>

<p >This defect, academic cheating, is a heart breaker for the teacher as well as the student.&nbsp; Getting the documentation trail together from an on-line class is pretty easy, and the on-line plagiarism detector is near perfect...&nbsp; but it's still a nightmare. &nbsp; Evaluating the written word is easy, but evaluating a computer program is dang-nigh impossible.&nbsp; I had one woman who sent in an OK kind of &quot;B&quot; work but a subdirectory had an invisible file attached that pointed to &quot;bought&quot; work.</p>

<p >She was a young woman who really wanted to go ahead with her life, but she was as lost in mastering the any aspect of technology (Directories?&nbsp; What's that?) -- Just not her strongpoint.&nbsp; And you can't buy your way into competence. &nbsp;Incompetence has a smell that can't be disguised to the trained nose.</p>

<p >Another student had taken a whole group project on him self.&nbsp; His work was excellent.&nbsp; But he had worked so much on that project that his other work was so fraudulent that it pulled his grade to D quality.&nbsp; The work was great, the plagiarism was not.</p>

<p >I had to report the offense, as the team captain was aware too.&nbsp; I knew a letter would be placed in his file, and if he had other offenses, more...</p>

<p >I felt that this guy needed both a carrot as well as a kick.&nbsp; The low mark on the project and the &quot;visit to the principals&quot; office.</p>

<p >In this case, I did not find out until after the grades were issued that he alone had done the heavy lifting on a project that was, quite frankly, a blockbuster powerpoint presentation.&nbsp; So, I sent in a petition to raise that guy's grade a whole letter.&nbsp; His grade was raised, and I hope he has continued the good work.</p>

<p >The kick and the carrot.&nbsp; His scholarship depended on that, in this economy, his error did not require a more severe a punishment.</p>
