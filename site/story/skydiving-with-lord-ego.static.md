<p>The airplane of humanity has the left ailerons voting &quot;up,&quot; and the right ailerons pointing &quot;down&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lord Ego, yes the same Lord Ego who threw water on Walter Cronkite during an interview, ejects from the plane and leaves with:</p>
<p>---------- Dateline 2055 New Detroit ------------</p>
<p >The late Lord Ego left a series of prerecorded press releases announcing the availability of the Pimp Group&rsquo;s services.&nbsp; He detailed the plans and time-lines for implementation for services well over a hundred years after his death.&nbsp; So far his uncanny ability to engineer social trends and technical advancement far into the future has yielded seventeen of these new ventures, and a full twelve of them are still profitable.</p>

<p >Here is the transcript of tonights startling announcement:</p>

<p >A very distinguished Lord Ego comes into view.&nbsp; We see sky, horizon, ground and sky again rotating dizzily behind Lord Ego.&nbsp; He is skydiving.&nbsp; The nude supermodel Loch Ness is clinging to his waist.</p>

<p >He speaks: &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Lord Richard Ego and this is Lock Ness.&nbsp; When you see this it will be, nearly 2060 or so.&nbsp; With the mounting social pressures here on earth, I wish to offer Pimp Galaxy!&nbsp; We are creating fully self sufficient solar re-fusioning stations in solar orbit.&rdquo;</p>

<p >At this moment Loch is overcome by panic as the ground gets ever closer.&nbsp; He continues aside: &ldquo;Whoa, Nessey!&nbsp; You are a spunky lady.&nbsp; Just give me a moment to finish this and then I&rsquo;ll pull the ripcord.&rdquo;</p>

<p >He continues with the announcement: &ldquo;Each one will accommodate a quarter million people as well as provide energy for good old earth, as you know, we need it.&nbsp; At this time, we have fully 10 of these and are offering one-way passage for a family of 5 at a deal that you will love. &nbsp; Jobs you will love, and a life that lies waiting for you! Thanks and have a great millennium!&rdquo;</p>

<p >Lord Ego shifts Loch Ness in his arms and the parachute opens at the Lords tug:&nbsp; &ldquo;Nessie, did I say I was going to pull the cord in time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>------------------- &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, Lord Ego's Pimp Galaxy project was an incredible success, &nbsp;more revelations came somewhat later. &nbsp;It is strange that Lord Ego seemed to miss only one major change in social development: that by 2044 men make up less than 3% of the population and, outside of a few professions, like wine and brewing, have little true social power.</p>
<p>(Author's note: &nbsp;Some of my readers may have taken my fist of Perhaps, to mean exactly what <em>they</em> think it means: the worst. &nbsp;I apologize, because perhaps that is incorrect. &nbsp;But if your feathers get riled, it IS worth thinking about. &nbsp;Or not.</p>
<p>Like this e-mail: some women might get pissed by Lord Ego's chauvanism -- so I put the bit in about males being relegated to minor positions in society to balance. &nbsp;And that might piss off the guys. &nbsp;I really hold neither position, but if you thought I did, you might want you to widen your own views. &nbsp;That's what laughter is all about, I'm told.)</p>
