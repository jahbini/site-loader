People used to smoke. &nbsp;Lots. &nbsp;Many still do, I'm not ag'in it. &nbsp;People are vegetarians now. &nbsp;I'm not ag'in it.

If butts could talk, the only way we could tell them is by the brand.

-------------------------------------------

Kool: Hey, hey, another ash in the tray! Looks like some new butt&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; our way.

Marlboro: Mmm. Could be somethin&rsquo;, Could be nothin&rsquo; &mdash; don&rsquo;t get excited.

Kool: Last butt here had some real hot embers to share. Oh. Look, another cig. That means there are two!

Marlboro: Could be anything. Maybe her aunt. Maybe her roommate.

American Spirit: I recognize my brand, my smoke, my savor. I bet it&rsquo;s from Harry.

Kool: No. Sue gave Harry the boot Tuesday. Hey? You Kool Too? I&rsquo;m Kool.

Kool: Yeah! Kool. I&rsquo;m Sue&rsquo;s. You?

Kool: Yeah. All us Kool&rsquo;s are Sue&rsquo;s. Even the ones without lipstick.

Kool: Not me, I&rsquo;m Stephen&rsquo;s! &mdash; He stole one in the wee hours.

American Spirit: Who&rsquo;s Stephen?

Marlboro: Grrr. Get with it has-been. Harry is history. It&rsquo;s me or Steven now. He smokes Camels mostly.

Kool: Give it up, Marlboro. You are just a cigarette butt. You were only joined to Carl for about five minutes at most, and then he just crushed you. Like all the rest of us.

Kool: Yeah, I like you, er. Sue likes Carl, but Steven is lots more fun. You both have a shot.

(Stub, Stub&hellip; Smash)  
American Spirit: Oh, my crap. That hurts. I was on fire, happy, joining with Sam, and then he just slammed me here. OMG. What a headache.

Marlboro: Sam! What! You were smoked by SAM?!? Who the hell is Sam?

Camel: Oh, Marlboro, you don&rsquo;t even know Sue&rsquo;s kid&rsquo;s friends. You are going Down! Sue will dump you sure.

(Stub, Stub, Stub&hellip; Grind, smash.)  
Kool: Ohhhhhh. Wheeeuuuu. That was crazy. Missy and I were enjoying the long ride down from the great feelings that Missy was feeling with Sam, and then Missy heard something, took a last drag and bam! I&rsquo;m history.

Camel: Hmm. Missy and Sam? &nbsp;Missy! &nbsp;Looks like you have a problem with your daughter, Sue.

Kool: Oh, shit. When Sue finds out she will be all over those two like nails in a coffin.

Marlboro: I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to be Sam right now.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; some time later &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;   
American Spirit, Camel, Kool, Marlboro: Look another ash! Maybe news!

(Stub. Grind. Stub, stub, stub. Grind. &hellip; smash)

Kool: Uggggh. Ohhhhh. Hhhuuuuuu. I tried. I&rsquo;m sorry Sue. I gave you all the nicotine I had. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything except be with you as you realized your kid was becoming a woman. Just like you, Sue. It will be all right.

-----------------------------

Like I say, I'm not ag'in smokers. &nbsp;Nor vegetarians. &nbsp;Ashtrays have more interesting conversations -- prove me wrong.
