<p >We recently had a Supreme Court decision that allows corporations to have the same rights of freedom of speech as us human citizens.</p>

<p >Let's just follow that logic for a moment.</p>

<p ><strong><em>In the world of the future</em></strong>, when Corporations take their place as real citizens of the USA, they must take on real responsibilities. &nbsp;For example, Jury Duty: &nbsp;All employees and Board of Directors must serve on Jury Duty, but they must vote as one juror.</p>

<p >Corporations are efficient: &nbsp;They keep telling that to us all the time, so they can figure out how to do that efficiently. &nbsp;Just give our fat-cats a problem, and they can answer the call.</p>

<p ><strong><em>In the world of the future,</em></strong> when Corporations take their place as real citizens of the USA, they must serve time for criminal offenses. &nbsp;Let's see how that might work out ---</p>

<p ><em><strong>In the world of the future, where General Efficiency has the rights of ordinary citizens:</strong></em></p>

<p >Salmon: Hey, buddy, what you in for?</p>

<p >Max: I'm Max, I'm the corporate man.</p>

<p >Salmon: Wuzzat? Corporate man? I been here since '04 and I ain't heard of corporate man.</p>

<p >Max: Sheeew, I thought you were an old-timer, don't you know nothin?</p>

<p >Salmon: Hey, I been&nbsp; in high security for too long.&nbsp; Fill me in.</p>

<p >Max: Ok, Salmon, here's how it works. &nbsp;Back in '13 corporations were forced to give up the rights of citizenship, because they were not &quot;people&quot;. &nbsp;So Fucking what.&nbsp;</p>

<p >Max: The corporations fought back, and won those rights in the &quot;Christmas shopper VS Walmart Greeter&quot; riot. &nbsp;Thing is, &nbsp;they have to do the duties of a naturalized citizen.</p>

<p >Max: So, Salmon, corporations have to vote in elections, sit on juries, and serve time for criminal acts. &nbsp; And I ain't sitting on any jury.</p>

<p >Salmon: So that means you are serving time for some corporation?</p>

<p >Max: &nbsp;Yup, that's me,&nbsp; I'm &quot;Mr. Whizzy&quot; Max.&nbsp; When near lethal amounts of scum-manium were found in bottles of Mr. Whizzy, heads rolled from Piscataway to Peking.</p>

<p >Max: I hired on as Corporate Fall guy and got a 10 to 15 year sentence.&nbsp; That's enough for full retirement from General Efficiency, Inc!&nbsp; Along with housing, health and dental benefits for my wife and kids. &nbsp;<i>And Grandchildren.</i></p>

<p >Max: I got another 3 years before I'm out.&nbsp; After that, the high level of my incrceration earns me a place on the fucking Board Of Directors!&nbsp;&nbsp;Today,&nbsp;I may live like a prisoner, but I'm gonna party like a Corporate FatCat for the rest of my life!</p>
<p>Salmon: Max, I gotta hand it to you.</p>
<p>Max: Yea, In fact, if you are willing to get your sentence extended, I can set you up with some sweet corporate deals that will set you up with great &quot;perks&quot; if you know what I mean.</p>
