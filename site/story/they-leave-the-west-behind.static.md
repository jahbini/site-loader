<p >All the way the paper bag was on my knee.  &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>
<p>I met Leo and Station early last month.  I have been given the OK by both of them to tell their story here.  It involves a computer chip I found in my bar of soap.</p>
<p >Georgia's always on my mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mind.  &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>
<p>Leo is an international expert in cyber security, and Station is his live-in estranged gay housekeeper.  Station is from the Philippines and his name means &ldquo;stations of the cross&rdquo; or something like that, but in English his name sounded too much like &ldquo;crustaceon.&rdquo;  He maintains the look of the whole neighborhood: it explains all the papasan chairs in the trees.  I&rsquo;m not sure about the estranged part, but they never talk to each other.</p>
<p>Anyway, Station had been giving me tips on organic gardening:  1/3 perlite, 1/3 moxibustion, 1/3 chicken adobo &mdash; That kind of stuff.  By the time he gets to the moxibustion, my eyes glaze over and I try to change the subject.</p>
<p>Me:  &ldquo;Did I tell you I found a computer chip in my soap this morning?  It&rsquo;s warm enough today for the pipes to unfreeze, so I took a shower, and in the last sliver of the bar, I found this tiny circuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Station: &ldquo;You should get another brand of soap.  Nicer to your skin than&nbsp;computer chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;It's free. &nbsp;I won a contest on the internet a couple of years ago: I get a lifetime supply of Georgia Soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time I said internet, Station&rsquo;s eyes glazed over and he kind of wandered down the bluff and continued stringing english ivy in the tree-tops.</p>
<p>As I walked back to my digs, Leo came running out of their house toward me: &ldquo;I hear you use Georgia soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me:  &ldquo;WTF?  Yeah, How&rsquo;d you know?  I found a chip in it this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p >Honey, disconnect the phone.  &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>
<p>Leo is kind of a celebrity in St. John&rsquo;s:  He always has a couple of bombshell ladies on his arm in public, but he never bring any of them back to his place.  He speaks with a bit of a brogue, and is slightly pompous and hardly ever answers a question.  He leaves for a few days every so often.  Station will just sit outside the front door and wait till Leo gets back.</p>
<p>Leo: &ldquo;But is the soap any good?   Or is it a pube magnet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soap.  Georgia Soap.  Soap with a goddamn computer chip in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo:  &ldquo;Of course.  Where you been?  Oh,  you didn&rsquo;t read the whole Puritan Act, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p >Been away so long I hardly knew the place..gee, it's good to be back home&nbsp;&mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Uh, no, uh, I was going to, but I never found time.  Or needed to go to sleep that badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo: &ldquo;Georgia bought out the entire technology from Bogostan when the Soviet Union broke up.&rdquo;</p>
<p >you don't know how lucky you are boys&nbsp;&mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Soviet Union?  Technology?  They would use a Sledge Hammer to smash an atom.  And there in no place called Bogostan. And what's that got to do with the U. S. Puritan Act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo: &ldquo;Forget the Soviet Union, I&rsquo;m talking Bogostan.   The Bogostani&rsquo;s had electronic surveillance tricks that we are still trying to figure out.  It&rsquo;s a country that is so secretive, it erased it self completely from all historical record in 1992.  It&rsquo;s mind boggling how they did that, but Georgia owns the technology now.  That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t remember.  Even now, we are still not sure if Bogostan really exists.  That&rsquo;s how good their technology is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;What <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=smart+dust&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">technology</a>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo: &ldquo;The GPS body scanner chips.  In the soap, dummy.  Don&rsquo;t you read the on-line user&rsquo;s manual for your soap?  You had 30 days from first shower, you know.  It&rsquo;s referenced in the U.S. Puritan Act under Appendix 23.A.21&mdash; &ldquo;mostly fair use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;GPS?  What the hell for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo: &ldquo;GPS, you know - Georgia Personal Surveillance -- The soap maps out every square inch of your body as you shower.  Tussaud&rsquo;s had secretly leased the technology from Bogostan for their Wax Museum:  That&rsquo;s why their wax statues are so realistic.  Nowadays, the scans are used to generate advertisements tailored to your body contours.  I bet you don&rsquo;t get any SPAM about breast enlargement, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;No, I get lots of ads for Peni&hellip;&rdquo;  My voice trailed off as the truth hit me.  They know.  Everything.  Every mole and freckle.  And it&rsquo;s in the soap!</p>
<p>Leo walked off down the bluff toward Station.  He stopped halfway, awkwardly looked around like a cat trying to pretend he had other business and then ran back toward his car and left.</p>
<p>Station stood up, walked to the front door of their house and sat down outside. &nbsp;That was over a week ago, and he has been sitting, silently looking up the roadway ever since.  Station hasn&rsquo;t done any work on the neighbor hood.  The english ivy is still only half-way up the trees.</p>
<p >I didn&rsquo;t get to bed last night, and now&nbsp;Georgia's always on my mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mind.</p>
