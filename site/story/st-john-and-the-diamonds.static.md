<div ><blockquote> Nature's first green is gold,&#8232;<br />
Her hardest hue to hold.&#8232;<br />
Her early leaf's a flower;&#8232;<br />
But only so an hour.&#8232;<br />
Then leaf subsides to leaf.&#8232;<br />
So Eden sank to grief,<br />
So dawn goes down to day.&#8232;<br />
Nothing gold can stay. &mdash; Robert Frost </blockquote>
<p>A virgin new year brings to mind Eden gone to grief, then we inhale our breath soon for Nature&rsquo;s hardest hue. It&rsquo;s coming. Rainfall will provide a drumroll entrance for her.</p>
<p>Our new year will see many new businesses start as gold: A hand-shake and newspapers on the windows gives way to a flurry of activity, and may come to grief in weeks. As CorpoChrist might have said: &ldquo;We will always have failing businesses&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
And we could easily say that St. John&rsquo;s was an economic Eden come to grief, That is equally true of many neighborhoods, nothing special there.</p>
<p>Strange, though, St. John&rsquo;s has been the last staying place for some of Portland&rsquo;s diamonds. No mere lumps of metal, these gems have facets that reveal beauty. St. John&rsquo;s have been quietly keeping invisible treasures hidden in plain sight &mdash; an incredible growth opportunity? Possibly. The world&rsquo;s most beautiful bridge? It's in the running. Willing workers? Oh, my yes. A human testament to reliability? We got that.</p>
<p >Crouchley Plumbing may still need the wagon wheel railings and horse tie rings that line the street curbs here and there in St. John's.</p>
<p >Wayne&rsquo;s barber shop has been home to Wayne since he walked down the gangway of the Battleship California after WWII. He still cuts hair every day and has a full plate of regular customers.</p>
<p >The 50's music at Patti's Home Plate or&nbsp;the quality of the food at the James John Cafe is as reliable as our constant pursuit of Politically Correct language. &nbsp;(I'm betting the PC stuff goes out of style quicker)</p>
<p>The popcorn popper that generated all the business last year is still going strong in St. John's. &nbsp;It will generate more this coming year, and more of those businesses have a chance to dip into our abundant resource of workers.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for the staying power of diamond, Mr. Frost? Even though after enough time, Wayne will close his doors, but until the bridge crumbles to dust, St. John&rsquo;s has diamonds.</p>
<p>Business as usual will be on us soon. &nbsp;We will inhale the New Year, and await Nature&rsquo;s hardest hue to hold...</p>
<p>Opportunities abound. Just know that the value may just last a bit longer than Mr. Frost may suggest.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be as tenacious as Wayne, or as stunning as our Bridge. But it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
