{{{First Name}}}, the City Council had their annual Parade of the Passions to kick off the holiday celebrations.&nbsp; Yup, already, the &ldquo;Passion Partners&rdquo; are presiding over meetings to make Christmas decorations all over St. John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Maxine Power, wearing a button reading: &ldquo;consensus uber alles,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Passion Partners are certified in [enhanced persuasion][0] techniques such as Political Correctness Boarding.&rdquo;

She assured me that the City Council knows what it needs: They have consensus.&nbsp; After spending a cordial five minutes in her presence, I went outside and begged Throntle for her needle.&nbsp; Consensus is a gateway drug.&nbsp;

The Christmas displays are coming: Southwick is taping snow flake strobe lights to his eyes for meditation.&nbsp; Roger likes the display at the BBird Tavern.&nbsp; It has been the same Christmas Display all year.&nbsp; The owner never has to re-paint it.&nbsp; Tommy plots to topple the Christmas tree made of beer cans over at the corner store.

There is one display that actually seemed to stand out.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t flashy or even &ldquo;artistically correct&rdquo; &mdash; it was [Grammy and Nonna's][1] toy store.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m not really into toys much, but these are the backbone toys for a great childhood.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; Wooden.&nbsp; Physical.&nbsp; Enduring classic toys made of kid-proof construction.

The display had these classic toys along with relics of christmas past.&nbsp; The ancient wind-ups and heirlooms that were prized when newly received on some past christmas day.&nbsp; If Christmas is for the kids, it takes a display like this to help us old fogies reach back to that time.

An amazing thing happened one morning a few days ago: The window of the store was broken and boarded up.&nbsp; Thick slabs of broken plate glass everywhere, but not even one item inside had been touched.&nbsp; No one seemed to know what happened.

I asked Sandy at the Hope for Health bar&mdash; &quot;Bob, er, Fred, er some homeless guy walks by; &nbsp;looks in, then he starts wobbling, &nbsp;then he just sorta popped somehow. &nbsp;Anyway he was gone and the window broke.&quot;

You heard it: &quot;He was gone and the window broke.&quot; Hard to believe, but Sandy deserves respect as a very talented martial artist.&nbsp; He has mastered the Breath of Death.&nbsp; I had to &ldquo;tap-out&rdquo; from Sandy&rsquo;s Dumpster Dojo and called in Southwick to consult the Akashic records.

Southwick chants powerful street incantations such as: _&ldquo;WouldaCouldaShoulda,&rdquo; &ldquo;GotADollar?&rdquo; &ldquo;WhatAreYouLookingAt&rdquo; f_or a few minutes and then goes all trance like.&nbsp; His eyes roll like Elmo.&nbsp; He speaks:

> &ldquo;Crap, it&rsquo;s cold.&nbsp; I need a drink.&nbsp; Life is shit.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Look at that crappy tin toy.&nbsp; I got one like it once..&nbsp; It broke.&nbsp; Gramp gave it to me.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s that stupid doll&hellip; Oh, it&rsquo;s supposed to be a kid rummaging through the presents,&nbsp; Yeah, just like I did.&nbsp; Look here&rsquo;s an American Flag just Uncle Fred&rsquo;s flag from &lsquo;Nam.&nbsp; We always had it out like he could be with us on Christmas.&nbsp; Crap, that was nice.&nbsp; Life was &hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;

Southwick says: &ldquo;The akashic street records stop there. Boom. The emotion was too hard to handle for this guy and he exploded.&nbsp; Even good memories can be too strong when they come on all at once.&nbsp; The combined effect of remembered childhood hope slammed into the concrete wall of eternal street life without the safety valve of possibility can muck up your whole day.&nbsp; Yup. Spontaneous Human combustion.&nbsp; Happens all the time to drunks.&nbsp; You should be glad he took his legs with him.&nbsp; Usually the feet are left behind.&rdquo;

I know everybody has been asking what happened to the window, so you heard it first on the St. John&rsquo;s Lighthouse.&nbsp; The akashic records do not lie.
