\section{suit of swords}

\paragraph{The suit of Swords is suit of the military -- Stormin' Norman. Clint Eastwood. Shifting and opportunistic loyalty. You may fight against an army one day, and fight with that same army the next. And you must be able to handle those changing loyalties. Not like the loyalty of the pentacles, who stick together and vote as one value driven block.}

\subsubsection{Ace of Swords}

\paragraph{A horn sounds outside the village,} a rider comes through the night. I'm here to spread the alarm. The north country has been invaded! Many have died and terror is all that remains there. We must prepare. Gather your strengths, gather your wise and your fighters. Prepare! I must go, I have told you all I can.Then he rode through the square, shouting "out of my way, Fool" and nearly knocked me over.Inverted. The warning may have come too late to help.

\subsubsection{Two of Swords}

\paragraph{The enemy to the north} is nearly unknown to us. Our king has summoned a secret meeting of elders. It does not go well. Our challenge is great, and our options are few. Now, this moment, is the time for our elders to take one last hour in counsel, and then we must commit all our efforts behind their decision. Shall we go forward, or retreat?

\subsubsection{Three of Swords}

\paragraph{Our first encounter} with the Northerners was devastating. The northerners are invincible in battle. We have sustained heavy losses already.This may be a temporary setback, we hope that we will prevail.

\subsubsection{Four of Swords}

\paragraph{Our best fighters} have fallen in battle. Even in the midst of conflict we must honor the price that each has paid, and the losses we have endured. We gather around a small family service. The son has died from his wounds, and is now laid in his full battle dress for his journey to his fighters reward as the heirophant has promised.May his death be worthy, and our future bright.Inverted. An unworthy death.

\subsubsection{Five of Swords}

\paragraph{We have been overcome,} their fighters roam freely in the streets. They easily defeat us on their terms. The grow strong as we grow weak. This is a dark hour.

\subsubsection{Six of Swords}

\paragraph{We salvage what we can of our former lives.} Our women and children are sent to safety across the sea. We must become invisible to our enemies.

\subsubsection{Seven of Swords}

\paragraph{By guile we have been learning the ways and weaknesses} of the northerners. We have found ways to sap their strength and blunt their weapons. We work in the dark and in secret. We must not be discovered.

\subsubsection{ Eight of Swords}

\paragraph{We have taken the northern's most prized possession.} She is our hostage. The enemy must listen to us now.

\subsubsection{Nine of Swords}

\paragraph{The norther king does not sleep.} His mind is confused. He lacks the will for battle. He has lost his drive, and terror in the night is his only friend.Our enemy is only as strong as it's will to prevail.

\subsubsection{Ten of Swords}

\paragraph{We have defeated the norther hordes.} Their fighters have fallen not to our strength, but our will to exist.

\subsubsection{Page of Swords}

A young girl with huge curiosity, she peeks into every drawer, and looks into every purse. Here you see her eavesdropping at the confessional.

\subsubsection{Knight of Swords}

Whether it is with armor, sword, or garrote, Alexander "Ax" Blade is the guy who will get the job done.\subsubsection{Queen of Swords}

The queen is in charge of logistics, resupply, and maintenance. She is chief counselor on planning and strategies.

\subsubsection{King of Swords}

\paragraph{The most experienced} in the real needs of war. Shifting loyalties, shifting strategies. Public displays and private deals. The sacred space for him exists because he can and will defend it. For no other reason. Anything more, cups, wands, pentacles, is all well and good, but can and will be sacrificed if necessary.

The suit of Swords is suit of the military -- Stormin' Norman. Clint Eastwood. Shifting and opportunistic loyalty. You may fight against an army one day, and fight with that same army the next. And you must be able to handle those changing loyalties.
