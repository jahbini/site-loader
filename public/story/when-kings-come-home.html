<p>New report demonstrates readers of &ldquo;The St. John&rsquo;s LightHouse&rdquo; can add up to 1/4 pound of neurons or more! While it restores bad breath!&mdash; remember, you read it first here.&nbsp;</p>
<p >A person who can quiet a toy terrier with a kindly and straightforward &ldquo;well done&rdquo;&nbsp; has a rare talent:&nbsp; It will be very useful for dealing with Kindergartners and City Council members.&nbsp;</p>

<p >I keep thinking that the Tarot Deck we normally use needs more archetypes that are adapted to our different social structures, modern stuff, bla, bla, bla. &nbsp; Some of the Major Arcana can be changed, or a few more options added. &nbsp;There could be more &quot;negative&quot; cards, but the whole thing is pretty optimistic and focuses on &quot;white magic:&quot;</p>

<p >The four suits seem well chosen, though: Agression, Business, Creativity, Compassion.&nbsp; And I keep realizing that when it comes to ownership, protection, stability, the king-domain king queen duality is the right one.&nbsp; Kings control Kingdoms. and as sexist as the Tarot is, the King husbands his kingdom.&nbsp; So the queen of Pentacles is the business, not the owner&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; My queen of cups is &ldquo;The St. John&rsquo;s Lighthouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p >I like to let my mind wander back to seemingly simpler times.&nbsp; I let my mind combine and mix those old times with whatever comes along, like when the iPod starts playing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/peterlang1">Peter Lang</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZBm7f6bALA">When Kings Come Home</a>&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp; I quickly came up with so many possibilities, that I couldn&rsquo;t decide which had more &ldquo;unique appeal?&rdquo;</p>

<p >That's because this decade is too complicated. &nbsp;In the future will this decade be called the twenty-teens? The decade when technology and culture merged?</p>

<p >Imagine a retro interview with product development leader for the fabulous iFrog, Mark Hurdygurdy had to say about that culture-bubble: &ldquo;Everybody was pumping out crazy gadgets.&nbsp; We had this thing, you know, it hopped around.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all it did. Who knew?!? Anyway, Apple always used the &quot;i&quot; in front of our product names back then, and Morty said: we can&rsquo;t us the name <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2009/09/ihop_leaders_den_again_that_the_church_is_really_a_cult.php">iHop</a>, And I replied &ldquo;we could make it iFrog.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the real story behind the name iFrog.&rdquo;</p>

<p >Who knows, It might make a great wireless toy so that we can tease cats via Twitter. &nbsp;Requirement for alien technology?&nbsp; Yes, No?</p>

<p >One of the kings from Honolulu sent word that the band was getting back together.&nbsp; That started me thinking about what possibilities might happen. &nbsp; My inner writer went through lots of possibilities.</p>

<p >I came up with this backstory framework so I would be ready for whatever possibility this band leader has in mind!</p>

<p >Pick one from each selection.</p>

<p >The king has gone to a foreign land. &nbsp;</p>

<p >Reason:</p>
<p >1) to chase invaders&nbsp;</p>
<p >2) to conquer foreign lands</p>
<p >3) to honor commitments to protect other lands</p>
<p >4) to escape a coup</p>
<p >5) Arrested for drug dealing (no kidding! this happened to my lawyer in HNL!)</p>

<p >The Kingdom as been without a king for&nbsp;</p>
<p >1) a week,</p>
<p >2) a year,</p>
<p >3) more than 5 years,</p>
<p >4) several generations,</p>

<p >And has returned.</p>

<p >1) The country has fallen on bad times and the king must restore order.</p>
<p >2) The country has become even more successful and the people no longer wish to have a king.</p>
<p >3) Having been exiled, the king is put under arrest.</p>
<p >4) Greeted as a hero.</p>
<p >5) DOA</p>
<p >6) The king brings alien technology and devours New York</p>

<p >Here is an easy one: 3, 4, 1 &mdash; Aragorn of Lord of the Rings.&nbsp; 3, 4, 1 &mdash; Old king went to protect all kingdoms and has not returned for generations, Aragorn returns to find Gondor under terrible siege.</p>

<p >My Lawyer? 5, 3, 3, Yup, As far as I know, he&rsquo;s still in the slammer.&nbsp; Never did get my tax stuff back from him.&nbsp; &mdash; Don't give your only copy to a lawyer.</p>

<p >Take your pick.&nbsp; Life has all of those playing in a conversation near you. &nbsp;Just start listening between the lines.</p>

<p >Special bonus (for today's readers only!): Work up a movie plot based on that theme.&nbsp; Get rich.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p >As far as the band? &nbsp;If I'm smart, I'll listen and say &quot;good job,&quot; &nbsp;especially if there's Alien Technology involved!</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
