<p>I'm safe again at my favorite haunt. &nbsp;[First Name], if you were here, we could share a bowl of the chickpea and ham soup.&nbsp; It's as fabulous as the rich foam on the espresso.&nbsp; But I'm forgetting: The location of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jamesjohncafe.com/">James John Cafe</a> is a secret.</p>

<p >That's why the ghost-busters were slow to arrive in St. John's,&nbsp; They got lost for a couple of days, I guess.&nbsp; They got here just before their Tri-Met passes expired and they should make short work of the ectoplasm from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RWS_Tarot_18_Moon.jpg">Great Harvest Moon</a>. &nbsp;Especially the phantom art gallery a couple blocks away. &nbsp;Everybody knows there is no art gallery in St. John's.</p>

<p >One of my companions here in St. John's is pretty unique, more balanced in the four Tarot suits than the everyday pentacle folk of St. John's.&nbsp; Enkidu is a lab quality glass-blower, and good enough at it to work pretty much when he needs it.&nbsp; Wild in his attitudes.&nbsp; Exotic in his attitudes is more like it:&nbsp; He taught skydiving at a Health Spa in Tibet for years.&nbsp; Lean like a giraffe.&nbsp; Worlds of experience to share.&nbsp; Buddha the Greek, you might say, or SteppenUberMensch.</p>

<p >I was waiting in front of <a href="http://www.plewsbrews.com/">Plew's</a> on Lombard to hear Johhny Love wail the version of Folsom Prison that he drags from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights">Hieronymus Bosch</a> landscape of his soul.&nbsp; As I wait, Enkidu becomes transfixed by a bouncing giraffe inside Plew's.&nbsp; I go in and get my brew.&nbsp; For some reason, I light my hair on fire, walk up to her with a note saying: &quot;I can introduce you to the SteppenUberMensch.&quot;&nbsp; I casually walk outside.</p>

<p >She instantly follows: I tell her that I'm the second craziest old-testament prophet on the streets of St. John's, and if she wants to meet the real Buddha the Greek, she can talk to that guy over there: his name is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Dr-Fi/Enkidu.html">Enkidu</a>. They talk.&nbsp; In the morning, a bamboo and willow grown together mark the spot.&nbsp; The ghost-busters have already taken care of it. &nbsp;</p>

<p >Johnny's music grew my hair back before he finished his gig.</p>

<p >[First Name], I swear that all the above is mostly true, and I still have the charred feather in my hat to prove it.&nbsp; Blame it on the moon.&nbsp; That's what Southwick tells me.</p>

<p >The ectoplasmic clean-up is over and all the phantoms are gone. &nbsp;All except that spectral <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/north-end-gallery-portland">North End Gallery</a>. &nbsp;I need to find out about that. &nbsp;Hmmm.</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
