<p>&nbsp;Last night, the Oregon rain reached the millisecond 100% saturation point:&nbsp; Everything instantly wet, through and through.&nbsp; Even my backpack.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s pretty amazing.</p>

<p >As I lay my tarot out to dry on the pool table of my cathedral of solitude under the Art Gallery, I hit upon this incredible scheme to wake the Muse. &nbsp;Shuffle and pick three cards: A destination, and two motif cards.&nbsp; The destination is &ldquo;across the bridge&rdquo; and the two motif cards are what might happen.</p>

<p >Today&rsquo;s three cards are the <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/ten-of-cups/">10 of Cups</a>,&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/the-magician-major-arcana-i/">The Magician</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://blissblvd.com/the-tarot/the-tower-major-arcana-xvi/">The Tower</a>.&nbsp; Too easy.</p>

<p >Southwick wanted to start the internet candle-lighting service, you know like votive candles in monasteries. VotiveSix.com -- &ldquo;We keep the light going&rdquo; &mdash; He would convert a warehouse into a series of altars stacked up like Cosco Shelves.&nbsp; He would rent out each altar, complete with burning candle, webcam and prayer of your choice repeated endlessly.&nbsp; Rental would be by the week, with automatic &ldquo;keep burning&rdquo; service for <span ><em>ONLY</em></span> ten percent extra!</p>

<p >The service became an instant success, and Southwick&rsquo;s candle empire grew.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the VP Of WebCams began diverting funds away from web-cams, and started showing customers the very same candle!&nbsp; The public outcry caused riots at Wall Street, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tristandc.com/">Tristan da Cunha</a>, and San Quentin Maximum Security.&nbsp; The losses were staggering as it became clear that the major customers were top bankers, politicians, and executives, who basically only have prayers as assets.</p>

<p >Southwick&rsquo;s empire faded, he decided that he would tend his own gardens and would keep his candles burning in his heart.&nbsp; At the end, he had wondrous thoughts of thankfulness as he walked into the light.</p>

<p >See?&nbsp; Too easy.</p>

<p >Hmm.&nbsp; Maybe we could hire holy men to pray to each altar.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you just imagine Bishops riding fork-lifts around a warehouse maze of mini altars?</p>

<p >Southwick is sure&nbsp;the Bankers would pay top dollar for that service,&nbsp; Hell, it&rsquo;s only money in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=federal+reserve&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Fed&rsquo;s</a> imagination anyway.</p>

<p >I'm sure that thought will comfort me as I slog home in torrents of H2O radiation from the sky.</p>
