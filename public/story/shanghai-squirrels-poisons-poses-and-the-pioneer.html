<p>I want a squirrel tail for my hat. &nbsp;Southwick is taking me on a tour of back-woods St. John's, deep into Tommy County to find out what uses they have found for a permanent Pacific Northwest resource: the common squirrel. &nbsp;The residents there say the county line is 50 feet around the nearest cop.</p>
<p>Southwick tells me that Ella used to work at Waterfront U. &nbsp;There was a scandal about embezzling that Ella got caught up in, and that Tommy was instrumental in keeping Ella out of jail.</p>
<p>Ella has small house near a wildlife preserve. &nbsp;Ella laughs a lot.  Weird laugh.  She is small and shriveled.  It looks like a life of cigarette smoke has sucked her vital essences and replaced them with creosote.  She could be 75, she could be 45.  Impossible to tell. There is a bench and vials of odd chemicals, tools and jigs for carving, shaping and mounting.</p>
<p>Ella has a notebook of photos of her work. The squirrels are in many poses. &nbsp;There is a &quot;moments from history&quot; section - &nbsp;Washington Crossing the Delaware, Lincoln's assasination, raising the flag at Iwo Jima, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire">Triangle Fire</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcW_Ygs6hm0">Major King Kong</a>. Serious stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most, though, are riding in cars or on motorcycles. A few are in Kama Sutra positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She talks taxidermy: &ldquo;I still use the old formulas.  It&rsquo;s hard to get arsenic and mercury any more, but Tommy can get anything.  Toxic Tommy!&rdquo; She picks up a syringe and starts poking it into her work. She cackles. She starts to wheeze.</p>
<p>I ask her about the old formulas: &quot;Arsenic and mercury are really nasty poisons that keep on killing, how can you use them so close to the nature preserve?&quot;</p>
<p>Ella replies: &quot;Where do you think Tommy gets the stuff from? &nbsp;This is the Willamette! &nbsp;He hauls out a ton, and I put back in a pound. &nbsp;It's cap and trade, baby. &nbsp;It's sustainable.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southwick pulls the package from Tommy.  Ella opens it: a group of squirrels enjoying Da Vinci&rsquo;s &lsquo;last supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She reads the note: &ldquo;Tommy says it&rsquo;s too high-brow to have them on chairs.  He thinks he can sell it if I put the squirrels on motorcycles. Tommy&rsquo;s been real good to me, what a great guy.  He really helped me after that awful business over at Waterfront U.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asks me if I want anything, and I ask the price of a squirrel's tail.</p>
<p>She replies:&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I only sell the whole pelt. &nbsp;I got a reputation, you know. I tell you what I can do, is to mount one on the front of your brim.  I do good work.&rdquo;  She points to one with squid tentacles where its head should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Nice work. I&rsquo;ll pass on a hat mounted stuffed squirrel.  I just want the tail for a hat-band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella: &ldquo;Nope, not much call for a squirrel without a tail. &nbsp;I got a reputation. &nbsp;The whole thing or nothing.&rdquo;  She starts cackling and wheezing repeating: &ldquo;a squirrel without a tail!&rdquo; and &ldquo;the WHOLE thing&rdquo; over and over like it is some sort of in-joke.  Mercury in the brain, I guess.  She starts to wheeze then straightens up, and asks me: &quot;Would ya fight for one? &nbsp;You can get into the ring.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm confused: &quot;Fight? Who? What?&quot;</p>
<p>Southwick gets one of those &quot;I'm gonna tell your mommie&quot; looks on his face and says &quot;Oh, no, Animal Fights? That's horrible&quot;.</p>
<p>She looks me in the eye. &nbsp;She says: &quot;This is why we don't like outsiders. &nbsp;We don't talk about things to outsiders -- Are YOU an outsider?&quot;</p>
<p>I notice the syringe needle in her hand and I put my voice into 'soothe the beast' mode and walk slowly backward: &quot;Uhh. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I'm totally OK. &nbsp;Southwick is cool, you know him. &nbsp;He's my good buddy.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She goes on: &quot;Tommy says Southwick can't do any harm, so he's OK.&quot; &nbsp;She explains: &quot;You can fight any animal you want in Pioneer's Pit. We have it on the last thursday of the month. &nbsp;Man against Nature. &nbsp;No guns allowed.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm a bit stunned. &nbsp;&quot;Pioneer's Pit?&nbsp;No guns? How does that work?&quot;</p>
<p>She goes on: &quot;You get five minutes in the pit. &nbsp;Squirrel, nutria, raccoon -- your pick. Max points going into the pit barehanded. &nbsp;When I'm judging, I give extra points for skin exposure.&quot; &nbsp;She winks at me.</p>
<p>I reply, &quot;What kind of match is it?&quot;</p>
<p>She starts to rant: &quot;Pioneer! That's what men were like in the old days. &nbsp;Fighting the wilds of nature: Man to Grizzly. With only a knife. &nbsp;That's not sustainable. &nbsp;We just don't have enough grizzleys to go around, and most of the men today are such wimps that they couldn't take on a pack of wolves let alone a puma. &nbsp;We gotta get back to that good pioneer spirit. &nbsp;The city-fied geeks over in Intel-town are lining up to get their scars with squirrels. It's gentrification! It's sustainable.&quot; &nbsp;She has a fury in her that would last about 10 minutes for any audience. &nbsp;Just long enough to get consensus.</p>
<p>&quot;Think you can take on a raccoon? &nbsp;I tell you what. &nbsp;Nutrias are the easiest. You go in with this syringe, I guarantee it. &nbsp;You win the fight, I'll give you a big discount on mounting it on your hat.&quot; She shows me the squid-head thing again. &nbsp;She looks me up and down and says: &quot;Like I said -- I give extra points for skin exposure. &nbsp;You go in completely bare, and I'll give you an <i>extra</i> special discount. On mounting.&quot;</p>
<p>I thank Ella for her time, explaining that I'm scheduled for heart surgery on the last Thursday of every month. &nbsp;For many months. &nbsp;We leave.</p>
<p>Southwick tells me he needs to make one more stop with his case of frozen squirrel.</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
