<p>Easter Weekend. &nbsp;What a bust. &nbsp;Friday and Saturday were ablaze with hope and fury. &nbsp;It seemed like Easter would be a fabulous day, and St John's city council could be happy about our purely business decision of dumping Spring in favor of Summer.</p>
<p>I bought into the hope. &nbsp;The bunny patrol even took me to bunny mansion. &nbsp;Everything was bunnylicious.</p>
<p>Sunday: dreary Sunday--</p>
<p>I even trimmed my beard to spruce up.  A group of us were going to see the sun as it rises over a diesel locomotive.  It happens every Easter in Portland. Very Special.  I missed the sustainable tree-house aerial ride-share tram at 5:30 AM, though. &nbsp;The weather was hard to figure out in the dark of the morning. &nbsp;Mostly wet. &nbsp;Cold too. &nbsp;Some wind. &nbsp;I began to suspect that Summer was trying to have Winter cover his shift.</p>
<p>I find Easter a confusing holiday.  It scampers around the calendar like a goat.  Too much like Aries.  &nbsp;The local Portland custom is wet, with possible cold and wind. &nbsp;As I waited for the ride-share that never came, I thought: Cold, wet and wind is weird for&nbsp;a kama'aina like me. &nbsp;And what about weird local customs like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1263100/Filipinos-nailed-crosses-whipped-Good-Friday-ritual.html">filipino crucifixion</a> or <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3525&amp;date=20060411">swedish witches</a>. Or weird global customs like Easter Egg hunts.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s this deal?  Egg hunts, unlike witches or crucifixion, have nothing to do with established Religious teachings. &nbsp;Now I could go into some anti-religious rant as some others might do, but I'm not going to do that today. &nbsp;However, if you ask, I can point you to wonderful mythological similarities. &nbsp;One of my favorite writers on the subject is <a target="_blank" href="http://truthbeknown.com/">Achyara S.</a> -- a very knowledgable and thorough lady: &nbsp;I wish she had a rich grandmother I could woo.</p>
<p>The truth is, that I like religions, and I want to go into a pro-religion rant. &nbsp;I think they are beautiful viral creations of humanity which give thanks for our inexplicable existence. &nbsp;All religious doctrine is <i>totally</i> conflicted, and not entirely holy (come on, admit it, even the best have flaws) but is entirely filled with the goal of obtaining a holy personal union with God. Now <i>that</i> is worthy.</p>
<p>What's not to love? &nbsp;Maybe the Insufferable Righteousness and destruction, but as a goal, connection with a higher plane is a pretty good idea, and if mythos or ritual gets you there, showy or not, go for it.</p>
<p>So how is hunting for eggs part of God&rsquo;s Plan?  I dunno, I&rsquo;m confused on that point, but I think it may be a great inducement for kids at the beginning of foraging season.  Foraging had it&rsquo;s big heyday in prehistoric times, but never really went completely out of fashion. Even now, you can get a Ph.D. in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging">Optimal Foraging Theory</a>.</p>
<p>More practically, scattering a few pretty-pretty things likely made modern, medieval, and prehistoric mommies&rsquo; lives easier by giving the kids a bit of fun to mix in with the otherwise continual work of inspecting nature for little tidbits of value.  A kid that gets the most eggs might just be the kid that finds the most berries or herbs.  And you don&rsquo;t have to be a genius, just patient and persistent.</p>
<p>As the dawn breaks, and I realize I'm not going to see the St. John's Fabled Sunrise through the wheels of a locomotive, my eyes see more of the foggy ground below: &nbsp;indistinct-- is that a snake or a hose? is that a foothold or a noose? &nbsp;Donald Trump's wig or a Molotov Suppository?</p>
<p>If the world is your oyster, you had better keep your eyes open. &nbsp;That's the essence of foraging.</p>
<p>Let us declare together this solemn oath: ( Congregation and Pastor) Easter is the Official Start of Prosperous Days and General Goodness. &nbsp;(Pastor) Hopeful seekers: I give you Foraging Season. (Congregation): Foraging Season. (All): Easter.</p>
<p>Monday, April 25.</p>
<p>Rain. Drizzle. &nbsp;Hail. &nbsp;Winter is all over Easter's wimpy hope and kicking some serious butt. &nbsp;I get my usual psychic bodyguard, Southwick, to do the channelling mojo.</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Oh Gracious, Celestial Spirit of the season, What has happened to our official prayer to Foraging Season? &nbsp; We made it public and everything. Woooo. Woooo.&quot;</p>
<p>Winter: &quot;Summer's overworked. &nbsp;He had to visit his Kids over in Cockaign. &nbsp;Anyway, I'm Winter, and you don't cut no slack from me. &nbsp;Deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Hey, whassup with the hope and switch campaign? &nbsp;Are you seasons running a presidency?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winter: Stop it right there! &nbsp;You tried to hire Foraging! &nbsp;You can't hire another Season! &nbsp;You went to so much trouble to fire Spring and now you try this?! I'm dumping you back into February for a while and freeze your skinny butt.</p>
<p>Me: &quot;OK, Spring, Umm. &nbsp;It seems that there is an availability for a full-time temporary position for climate delivery in St. John's. &nbsp;You will have to supply all the resources: water, sunlight, air, etc, etc. &nbsp;The position is available immediately, but if you don't accept now, I'll have to give it to Foraging Season.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring: &quot;Beg me.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>Winter: &quot;You heard her. &nbsp;Beg or suffer the consequences of eternal February.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;OK. &nbsp;Spring, your most mercurial promises always take us by surprise. &nbsp;We are surprised when you break your promise, and we are surprised when you keep your promise. &nbsp;I St. John's Jim, humbly beg you to return to your old job.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring: &quot;Well, yes. &nbsp;In a couple of days. Maybe. I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Spring: Can't live with it, cant live without it.<br />
