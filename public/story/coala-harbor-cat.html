<p>I had two cats, Cobbee and Coala, when I lived on my boat in Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>
<p>Jim: Southwick, here's your assignment. Make a voyage to the akashic bar and grill, where all the fogged memories of mankind are stored, and get Coala&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>Southwick: &nbsp;Woo, Woo, Woo, Bookoo Snafoo. &nbsp;Akashic records now I view.</p>
<p>Jim: That's just freaking corny. &nbsp;Are you sure that's how to channel a cat?</p>
<p>Southwick: Take a back seat, buddy. Let me work here. &nbsp; -- Coala, Coala, make yourself known-la.</p>
<p>Jim: &quot;known-la?&quot; -- give me a break.</p>
<p>Southwick: Butt out. Shhh.</p>
<p>A voice: Miaw?</p>
<p>Southwick: Hey, Coala!  Miaw!  Come, sit wit me.  I&rsquo;m a friend of Jim, your old chum.  Lemme know wassup?</p>
<p>Coala: Jim? Yeah, he was OK. Chum? &nbsp;I love chum. &nbsp;It's fish scraps. &nbsp;You gonna pick up the tab?</p>
<p>Southwick:  You know me,  I&rsquo;m good for it, as long as there&rsquo;s a good story in it.  Hey! Bartender! Gimme a high colonic with a chaser of holy water, and what ever my friend here wants.</p>
<p>Coala: water and fish offal. It&rsquo;s my favorite!  You know I never got that since I moved from the Harbor.</p>
<p>Southwick: Fish offal? um. Er.... (silence.) Anyway, how&rsquo;d that harbor life work out for you?  Anything fun happen there?</p>
<p>Coala: Yeah, sure!  I got to sit in the Santa Barbara sun in the afternoons.  Cobbee and I shared the boat with Jim. Cobbee and I would pry open his crock-pot and scatter his dinner around the boat when he was gone. &nbsp;We were careful, though, he knew all these human tricks.</p>
<p>Southwick: Tricks?</p>
<p>Coala: Yeah, magic stuff, like how to lock doors and move his fingers and shit.  Make real deamons!  He could turn dead snakes into deamons.  Make food appear by magic.  Human stuff.</p>
<p>Southwick: I got the moving fingers thing, but what about the snakes?</p>
<p>Coala:  Snakes hate cats.  They are evil kitten killers, and we got to put the big fear into &lsquo;em.  It&rsquo;s fun, too.  Jim could make dead snakes come alive with his demon magic.</p>
<p>Southwick: You mean like when Jim would shake a some rope for you to play with?</p>
<p>Coala:  Rope?  Yeah.  And boat-lines and yarn snakes too.  Lots of &lsquo;em in the harbor.  They would be dead.  Dead, dead.  And Jim would pick one up and POW!  It lives!  I would kill it every time!</p>
<p>Southwick: You really know how to have fun.</p>
<p>Coala: You said it buddy!  I hung out on the dock most afternoons.  I&rsquo;d sleep, or watch the other boats for signs that their dead snake boat-lines would turn into deamons.  I would watch the birds.   I would keep the gulls off track as I looked for fish heads on the docks.  That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Southwick:  What was the craziest thing that happened there?</p>
<p>Coala: Well, sometimes Jim would set sail.  That was usually not fun.  Cobbee hated it and got real cat-sick to show how much he hated it. &nbsp;Jim lost lots of shirts to Cobbee's puke. &nbsp;Me? I had survived all the sea deamons, so I knew it would be all right.</p>
<p>Southiwick: Sea demons? &nbsp;What were the sea demons like?</p>
<p>Coala: Yeah, ALL of the Sea Demons.  I&rsquo;m a survivor.</p>
<p>Here's how it went down:&nbsp;Jim often let me wander in the afternoons, and sometimes he left the hatch open at night. I&rsquo;d jump on deck.  There were never any seagulls out at night, so I went to all the boats I could.</p>
<p>There was one boat that had a whole bag of chopped frozen fish on the deck.  I couldn&rsquo;t resist, and jumped up to get my share before the sun came up.</p>
<p>Just then, three big humans walked right ON the boat!  Oh, shit. Untrained humans.  You never know what they might do.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to train as many humans as possible.  I had never trained any of these guys, so I ran to hide in a little box in the cockpit. &nbsp;I was safe. &nbsp;Or so I thought.</p>
<p>I waited for them to go, but instead, they woke up a growling evil demon inside the boat that wanted to eat me. The boat rocked back and forth like an earthquake.  I hid.  I thought I was going to die.  Shit.  Humans.  Fucking magic.</p>
<p>Southwick:  Yeah, The engine, I guess, that must have been scary.</p>
<p>Coala: You said it, bub.  Hey, when&rsquo;s my order going to be ready?  I want my meal.</p>
<p>Southwick: Um. It&rsquo;s coming, here, have this instead.</p>
<p>Coala:  Wow. A piece of soy with the flavor of chicken heart. &nbsp;Is that all you got?</p>
<p>Southwick:  (squirm), Um. soon, soon. &nbsp;So what happened on the boat?  After they started the engines?</p>
<p>Coala:  Well, it must have been about an hour, and then they killed the engine demon.   But the earthquake was worse.  I was just getting sick, when one of the guys open up my hiding place and stuck his hand in!  His magic human hand!</p>
<p>I tell you, I let out a shriek and jumped right out!  I sailed through the air from the cockpit to the deck.  There were two humans their with huge sticks in their arms!</p>
<p>Southwick: &ldquo;You mean fishing poles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coala: No, sucka!  They were sticks with snakes that had nasty teeth!</p>
<p>Southwick: &ldquo;You mean fishing line and hooks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coala: Hey, don&rsquo;t interrupt me.  I&rsquo;m just getting to the scary part.</p>
<p>Southwick: MORE scary?</p>
<p>Coala:  So I land on the deck and these guys are freaking out.  Anything is better than being sick on a boat with the engine demon wanting to eat me and being surrounded by magic humans with snakes with teeth. So I jump back on to the dock.</p>
<p>Would you believe it?  These humans had made the dock disappear!  They made the whole freaking harbor disappear.  All there was was water everywhere.  And I was in it!  Talk about a demon.  Water is the worst.  You can kill a snake, but you can&rsquo;t kill water.</p>
<p>I fought hard to keep the water deamon from swallowing me.  I don&rsquo;t know how long I fought and I was nearly ready to give up, and a miracle happened!  I was lifted out of the water by magic snakes!  The humans had trained these snakes to hold hands somehow. I was put back on the deck. Wet.</p>
<p>Southwick: Holy, Holy, Hosannahs! By the eyes of the Saints! A Miracle!</p>
<p>Coala:  Yeah, They called it a fishnet, but it wasn&rsquo;t made of fish.  Stupid name.  They should call it snake nest, if you ask me.  I hate snakes.  Do you know how humiliating it is to be saved by skinny snakes? &nbsp;And I'm all WET?! That's really insulting. That's the kind of magic that freaks me out. &nbsp;Jeez, humans.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ran down to the lowest part of the boat.  It was the farthest from the water that I could get.  And nowhere the humans could go.</p>
<p>Southwick:  What happened then?</p>
<p>Coala: I waited. After a while, the humans started the engine demon again. &nbsp;I kept hiding and waited till afternoon.  The humans stopped the engine, turned off the earthquake and left the boat.  I waited till evening.  It was quiet.  Someone came a couple of times and pretended to be mama.  It could be Jim, but I didn&rsquo;t trust any human. After all, where was <i>HE</i> when the dock disappeared!</p>
<p>When the moon was up, and I could see that it was really him, I came out and he took me home. &nbsp;The ordeal was over. &nbsp;I survived.</p>
<p>And he had dinner ready too. &nbsp;So, Southwick buddy, what about my fish?  Are you gonna pay up?</p>
<p>Southwick:  Well, Er. Um.</p>
<p>Coala: Hey!  What are you?  An akashic cosmic welcher?  You said I get fish offal! &nbsp;Watch out or I'll pee on your underwear.</p>
<p>Jim: Holy cat piss! Southwick!  Mandatory meeting!  Give Coala what he wants!  It&rsquo;s a good story.</p>
<p>Southwick: What are you doing in this seance? And, <i>pu-leeze</i>, entrails? My Jagged Guru would NOT approve.</p>
<p>Jim: Southwick, don't pull any &quot;holier than thou&quot; crap when you read the Akashic Records. &nbsp;I want my underwear without cat pee on 'em.</p>
<p>-- Hey, Coala, good buddy, you remember me?  Miaw, Purr, Purr. Here is your fish: you know fish offal isn&rsquo;t good for you: it causes you to break out in bumps.  Purr. Next time let&rsquo;s stick to real cat food, OK?</p>
<p>Coala:  Thanks Jim.  You&rsquo;re OK too, but your food is pretty boring.</p>
<p>Jim:  Ciao and Miaw for now, Coala, thanks for the story. &nbsp;You can feast all you want here at the Akashic Bar and Grill. &nbsp;It's always afternoon in Santa Barbara for you my good cat. &nbsp;Plenty of fish for you. &nbsp;It's all on my tab: after all, I'm the author.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what harbor life was like for a cat in Santa Barbara, CA.  As far as Southwick, I&rsquo;ve asked him to teach ALL of my characters how to channel. &nbsp;My underwear can&rsquo;t afford to be at the mercy of Southwick&rsquo;s Jagged Guru.  How come there are no smooth gurus?</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
