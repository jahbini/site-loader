<p >Seamstress.&nbsp; A woman who sews.&nbsp; Not a man who sews.&nbsp; But try as I might, there is no unisex term that I know of.&nbsp; The word would be seamster.&nbsp; But seamster isn't a word.&nbsp; You have never heard it in use. ipso facto, Tempus Fugit, Notary Sojak, <em>IT AINT A WORD</em>!</p>

<p >But here in the Politically Correct, Stake of Oregon Through Your Chest, Hope to Make You Cry, Pacific North West&nbsp; ( God's own country, He whizzes here daily) you had better be especially gender neutral!</p>

<p >I had the unfortunate experience of dropping the 'girl' word in an otherwise pleasant conversation.&nbsp; The topic was instantly hijacked on the negative implications of the word &quot;girls&quot; and the stereotyping of gender, while I backpedalled all the way to the womb to figure how to explain my way out of this predicament.</p>

<p >Gender language is especially sensitive in Portland.&nbsp; We have a wide variety of folks of all persuasions, accomplishments, preferences and passions.</p>

<p >Tolerating and respecting are one thing.&nbsp; Showing an active interest and deference?&nbsp; Mmmm.&nbsp; Sorta.&nbsp; Maybe another thing entirely.&nbsp; But not to our Oregonians.&nbsp; If you are passionate about a thing, you have the active right to take me to school every time I cross over into your emotional-mental territory.&nbsp; At least that's the sensitivity rule in Portland.&nbsp; Oregon.&nbsp; Left Coast. USA.&nbsp; And, in fact, endorsed by none other than several rulings of The Supreme Court of The United States of America.</p>

<p >So let's get on board with our new word:&nbsp; Seamster.&nbsp; A person who is a laborer in the garment industry on sewing equipment.</p>

<p >You better get with it, and be very careful.&nbsp; The Seamster's Union is a very powerful agency here in Portland.&nbsp; And here in St. John's? Very Powerful.&nbsp; You've been warned.</p>
