<p>I got a huge backlog of one or two sentence introductions to this issue of the St. John’s but none with even a hope of kick-starting my new MuseCycle 900.</p>

<p>You see, Tommy convinced me that I had so many projects that I needed to get a replacement for the old-school goddess muse and get a model that pumps out greeting cards, facebook wall comments, ad copy for rent-a-used-fencepost business (that last is a trendy business on the Malibu of St. John’s. — There is a ready made library of twigs, sticks and branches in Baltimore Wood).  It just seemed to make business sense. Tommy said he had connections with an overseas supplier.[comment:Soto: Lets start a community library of tools from old construction projects.  People can check out drills, saws and stuff!]</p>
<p>[comment:Voce:So how is that different than what we got <a  href="http://www.northportlandtoollibrary.org/">already</a>?]</p>
<p>The MuseCycle 900 was a mess to put together, and the parts and packing are scattered around my mind.  I got most of the steps completed and finally got around to reading the instructions.  It said: “<em>Attention: requires operation by authentic classic goddess muse</em>.”</p>
<p>Tommy had scammed me!  Can you believe it?  Scammed by my own comic creation?  I know it’s impossible, but there is simply no other explanation.  When the muse don’t sing, ALL explanations work.  So believe me.</p>
<p>I rushed over to Tommy, OR, and knocked.  Tommy was hiding in the back.  He does that sometimes, in case it’s a bible salesman or old girl friend.  I thought: "Tommy, you simpleton, you have no idea who you are dealing with, I’m the fucking AUTHOR!"</p>
<p>So I unleashed my signature ninja move, the hallowed [roar:<em>Roar of the Lion]</em>: “Southwick, open the door.  Now.  Where’s Tommy!  What’s he done to my muse!  Where is Wickie?”</p>
<p>Southwick opened the door, and I went out back where Tommy was painting racing stripes on a caterpillar tractor.</p>
<p>Me: “OK, Tommy, bust loose with the truth, buddy.  I’m the author. So help me, I’ll start writing you in the style of Faulkner!  You will only be a hollow object of pity. The scum of mythology.”</p>
<p>Tommy replied: “Oh, no, not that...  OK, well you and I thought it would be a good idea to juice up the voltage on the writing thing, and you got all that tree-hugger organic muse fodder and everything.”</p>
<p>Me: “Muse Fodder!  You cant talk about <em>Wicked Compassion</em> that way!  A muse is a delicate and sophisticated deity of perfection — able to distill reality into wisdom”</p>
<p>Tommy replied: “Don’t let no muse fool you: They all want one thing.  Anyway, I got her here.  She’s no use to me, she doesn’t write porn.”</p>
<p>Me: “Tommy, if she is going to write porn, she ain’t gonna do it for you, buddy.  No more mucking with my muse again”</p>
<p>--“Not so fast, bub,  I’ll make Tommy a porn star if I want to.  Look at him there, he’s balancing a beer on his pects, no, let’s make it an outboard motor.  Yup, a much funnier image than reality.”</p>
<p>Me -  “Oh, Wickie, where you been, I’m missing you so much…”[comment:Voce:Did he just call her 'Wickie'?!][comment:Soto:Just imagine what <em>she</em> calls him!]</p>
<p>Wickie - “Well, you could stop chasing me!  I’ll come out when I feel safe and want to have a fun time.  And more Talking Heads, and Van Morrison, too.”</p>
<p>Me - “I’ve got a MuseCycle 900!”</p>
<p>Wickie - “That cheap ass thing, I’ll bet Tommy got it from one of those Chinese Hi-tech sites where he gets his "prescriptions".  Watch out for that stuff!</p>
<p>   --   If you are a real author, you’ll get me the MuseCycle 902.  It’s got the GB Shaw option. Or would you like Two Weeks of False Starts?”</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
