<p>The Seraphim of the James John Cafe are exceptional, [First Name].&nbsp; Yes, in addition to the fabulous food, my mezzanine table view shows me angels of all sort: Ones you can see, and ones you can't.&nbsp; Writer's territory.&nbsp; I watch sometimes as they let the cherubim out for a walk.&nbsp; Today, I'm sitting with Southwick: He saw Elvis in the ice crystals of his water.</p>
<p >On my shortcut through the park, I noticed a dozen or so 4 year old angels running to the play equipment.&nbsp; No cell phones, no texting, just good clean joy of the moment: running, pushing, climbing, laughing and yelling.&nbsp; The world they will live in will take most all of that away all too quickly, and what will they inherit in return?&nbsp; Decay or Deliverence?</p>

<p >How the heck will we create a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/313870/utopia_essay_on_thomas_mores_ideal.html?cat=9">better world</a> if we don't know what it is?&nbsp; Are we using of band-aids on our present system, or a morphing of our system to something that better serves humanity?&nbsp; And what is the architecture of that future?&nbsp; It's constitution?&nbsp; What are the eternal values?</p>

<ol>
    <li>humanity survive.&nbsp; -- if we can't survive, we might as well blow up the universe, &quot;Fuck It: [First Name], Tell Dr. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/images?q=rotwang">Rotwan</a>g to hit the switch labelled bang!&quot;</li>
    <li>humanity thrive. -- Maslow's scale is a good place to start.&nbsp; if we can't thrive, we might as well blow up the universe, &quot;Fuck it: [First Name], Tell Dr. Rotwang to hit the whimper switch.&quot;</li>
    <li>Goals of humanity.</li>
    <li>Rights of populations, organizations, individuals.</li>
</ol>

<p >Lots of buttons need to be made for items 3 and 4, we can ask kindly Dr. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/">Tesla</a> to make them.&nbsp; [First Name], what are their labels?&nbsp; how important are they in the scheme?&nbsp; It is all right to say &quot;everybody should have clean water,&quot;&nbsp; but the real importance of a value needs to translate into making it really happen.&nbsp; Penalties and rewards: a corporation that really delivers clean water to the world needs great reward.&nbsp; A fish pooping in the water should go to jail.&nbsp; ([First Name], this is serious, not solemn, wit is valued.)</p>

<p >What values do you want to suggest, [First Name]?</p>

<p >Southwick suggests that every person carries their own reality interpretation engine in their heads.&nbsp; He thinks that the common elements of personality and values clump together in patterns he calls archetypes.&nbsp; He likes the archetypes of the Tarot:&nbsp; mostly because of the vague and distributed history of the thing.&nbsp; That's exactly the way <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomy</a> works.&nbsp; He wants everybody to have the Sun and World as well as the 10 of Pentacles and 10 of Cups. Oh, <em><strong>goodie</strong></em>. &nbsp;Well, they are good archetypes, and hell, let's be kind to demented old Southwick and run with it.</p>

<p >5) Sun, World, 10 of Cups and Pentacles for everybody.</p>

<p >Southwick also mentioned that he imported a cougar into Tommy, OR.&nbsp; He cowered in the corner of his attic while the big cat paced the floor and marked the room with fermented <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha">Kambucha</a>.&nbsp; On the third night, Southwick let the window open and now she prowls the skate board park.&nbsp; Lures 'em into the tennis courts, then over to the polo fields.</p>

<p >&quot;Ahh, the visions of sugar-plum fairies that await these young men,&quot; Southwick sighs.&nbsp; He is proud to be part of the <em>Kougars for Kollege Kids</em> campaign.&nbsp; He says: &quot;Best way in the world to reach a jock.&nbsp; If it doesn't kill 'em, it makes 'em stronger.&nbsp; It's a double whammy of the High Priestess and Strength: Powerful Medicine.&quot;&nbsp; Sounds good coming from a guy who sees Elvis in his ice water and Mickey Mouse on his watch.</p>
