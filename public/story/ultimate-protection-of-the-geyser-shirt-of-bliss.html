<p>I have a shirt with a leaky pocket.  I&rsquo;ve lost thirty something bucks in the last week as they kind of wiggle up and out of the shirt like pollen from a flower.  They certainly fertilize someone&rsquo;s nest egg.</p>
<p>I got blood red mad; at myself of course, but realized that I&rsquo;m not really very careful.  Never have been.  Pound foolish, Penny foolish, but willing to shoot for the moon.  It will take a more than an act of congress to help me out of that fix.</p>
<p>Still, as I think about it, I haven&rsquo;t been mugged recently.  And then the truth hit me:  I have not lost those dollars, rather, I have purchased &ldquo;thug protection insurance.&rdquo;  A thief doesn&rsquo;t have to confront me at all, all he has to do is walk behind me and wait for the money geyser shirt to erupt.</p>
<p>I figure a guy can make 20 bucks in a day of recycling beer cans, but can make 10 bucks in 15 minutes of following me.  In fact, the big thugs will fight off the little thugs:  it&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way.  I end up with a parade of toughs behind me, and I&rsquo;m able to proceed along my path in quiet bliss.</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;ll not stuff money in that shirt pocket again, but I&rsquo;ll be giving up my thug protection. I&rsquo;ll just start worrying again about protection and insurance.  And that costs big time.&nbsp;</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
