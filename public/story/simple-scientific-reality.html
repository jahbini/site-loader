<p><span >I had another dentist appointment.&nbsp; It took about two hours for them to find the right anasthetic.&nbsp; As the third round of injections kicked in I had enough time to read the National Scientific magazine.&nbsp; In there it mentioned that Science now believes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-time-an-illusion">time is an illusion</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p ><span >Ha, They Indian mystics have been pushing that <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(illusion)">reality is illusion</a> crap for centuries:&nbsp; Is that all you got Mr. Science?&nbsp; (Science now believes? -- Can a non-human believe? Doesn't <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dougobriensblog.com/reverse-meta-model-selectional-restriction-violation/">make any sense</a>, but we swallow it anyway.)</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >No, for science to be science, it has to be duplicatable.&nbsp; So, Mr. Science, duplicate space and time.&nbsp; Not simulate. (Can an author talk to a mythical Mr. Science?&nbsp; Doesn't make any sense, but we swallow it anyway.)</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >So reality is an illusion after all.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Thank goodness. &nbsp;<em>And we paid these guys all these centuries for this?</em> &nbsp; And then the anesthetic kicked in and the pain became an illusion, too. Thank goodness.</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >I'm at the James John Cafe as I write this, and they just handed me my chops.&nbsp; Dad-GumIt!&nbsp; [First Name], I come here today as a flaming pillar of creativity, and I can't concentrate on the writing when the food is this good.&nbsp; Grrr. &nbsp; Suzanne countered (It's her counter): &quot;there would be NO writing at all without the great vittles, and Jim, you should be dad-gum grateful to even get inside a secret location like this.&quot;</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >I'm getting together another grub-stake expedition up the entrepreneurial rivers of technology.&nbsp; Thar's gold in them thar&nbsp; business opportunities.&nbsp; Biz-ops. Over at the Tropic of Oregon they have grow-ops.&nbsp; I look for push-ops.</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >Push-ops.&nbsp; I push the buttons now, and the buttons I push make a 'puter do something fun, interesting or useful far into the future: at the push of a button.&nbsp; That's what programmers do.&nbsp; It takes months and an 18 hour a day meditative concentration that's akin to zen chess. &nbsp;Makes me want to go &quot;Yeee-Haaa&quot;.&nbsp; Just like a portrait painter, tell me what you want the machine to do, and I'll write the program. On time, under budget and outperforming the specifications.&nbsp; Web applications. No smaller projects than 6 man-months.&nbsp; Just don't expect me to pay attention to anything else.</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >And what would I be missing in my gone-a-zen state?&nbsp; I'd be missing out on some exciting stuff over at the North End Galleries: an underground pool-table of energy bouncing around in worker chaos lines, all choreographed to come together this weekend (Oct 16, 2010).&nbsp; Show, Art, Music, Drama, Studios, Blessings and likely, Cursings.</span></p>

<p >I tackled one of the chaosographers: Orion, surprisingly beltless and earthbound, and asked him for the facts: &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragnet_(series)">what are the facts, just the facts, sir</a>.&quot; &nbsp;He said: &quot;<u>Doors open @ 1:00 P.M. Music starts at 2:00 12 bands All Ages Local heroes - Likity, Cheap Meats, Teflon, and Mannaquin Head! $3.00</u>&quot; -- He disavous any reports of half-pipes, or any pipes at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >Stuff for the young,&nbsp; Stuff for the trendy, Stuff to get St. John's Moving! &nbsp;That's the hope.</span></p>
<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p ><span >Now lissen up, [First Name], I have basically getting disbelief from my readers about, well, basically, the Three Wise Men over at Gunas Lp -- Let me inform youse guys:</span></p>
