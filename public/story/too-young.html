<p>I saw a performance by a Jackie Evancho, a truly gifted child with a fabulous voice.  It is the kind of voice that inspires any well-connected agent to call God directly and schedule her try-out for the voice that announces the Second Coming of Christ.  In song, she carries the Gravitas of Morgan Freeman, The World-Wise qualities of Nelson Mandela and the resonance of Kate Smith.  She is equally at ease in duets with Barbra Streisand or Susan Boyle.</p>
<p>Like I said, fabulous.  But with an odd hitch.  Watching her sing weirded me out.  Not just me, a couple of other people mentioned the same thing.  Why should excellence be weird?</p>
<p>My guess is that it had to do with her child like nature.  A kid is not supposed to know all about the emotional depths of intense life and death romantic love that is needed to understand Bernstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Place for Us.&rdquo;  But this kid conveyed that emotion perfectly.</p>
<p>Close your eyes, you would swear that this soul had swam in hormone hurricane churned seas &mdash; slammed against the sad rocks of society&rsquo;s expectations &mdash; and finally accepts the doom of Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>Open your eyes, and you see a body that should be singing &ldquo;I love Barney,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sharing is Fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same way that &ldquo;Little Miss Sunshine&rdquo; pointed out the creepy nature of Pre-pubescent Beauty Queens, this young lady has poked a similar button.  But she has done nothing wrong, and is just expressing her gifts as a performer and a human being.  Like &ldquo;Little Miss Sunshine&rdquo; herself &mdash; simply a little girl with a dream and some inspired coaching, she is reaching for a goal that inspires her.  The abreaction is mine alone, It is me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s MY expectation of human development that gets punched in the nose by the &ldquo;fist of perhaps.&rdquo;  &mdash; either children have a greater emotional capacity than I know, or that she is simply a capable performer who can &ldquo;fake&rdquo; the emotions with expert ease.  An actor does that for breakfast, lunch and dinner, why not a little girl?  After all, it&rsquo;s just a performance.</p>
<p>Obviously, the answer is both.</p>
<p>But if she sings The Kink&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lola&rdquo; with equal passion,  I am running for cover!  Lord save us all.</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
