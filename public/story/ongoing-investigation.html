<p>I&rsquo;m at the James John Cafe, where Seraphim make espresso with a crema so perfect, it puts velvet fog on your tongue.</p>
<p >This cafe (at a secret location, don't ask) has a homey harvest warm PNW primitive motif that fits perfectly with the real homey harvest PNW outside.&nbsp; Unpretentious, Mmmmmmmgglgl.</p>

<p >One of St. John&rsquo;s ballsiest Knights of Pentacles &mdash; The worker guys, you know, is 100% the wildest guy I know.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;I got the LAW on my side. &nbsp;I'm part of an Ongoing Investigation!&rdquo;</p>

<p >Here is his ballsy story:&nbsp; It seems years ago a certain Knight was out doing a bit of creative burglary, got caught by the sherrif, but got involved with a deal: &nbsp;transfer <strong><em>lots</em></strong> of booty to the sherriff&rsquo;s garage, No Questions Asked.&nbsp; This required all parties involved to be very hush-hush about the whole thing:&nbsp; The sherriff simply marked the Knight involved as being under a Ongoing Investigation at the highest level.&nbsp; Any time the Knight got in trouble, the sherriff would just get a release for him and say they wanted to keep an eye on him, but no detective would ever get assigned to the case.</p>

<p >We all know that there is NEVER any corruption in government, so his story must be false, what a relief! &nbsp;However, If so, Pretty Kewl! &nbsp;&mdash; The Law was on his side.&nbsp; Now that will encourage ballsy behavior, I&rsquo;ll bet.</p>

<p >A real King would get the best lawyer, too.&nbsp; A big difference between a Knight and a king.&nbsp; The Knight is just profiting off of blind luck, and the King is profiting from good strategy.&nbsp; All the great Robber Barons were Robbers, the war-lords Killers, they were just very good at strategy and execution.</p>

<p >I asked Southwick to help with my Ongoing Investigation into the strong-arm tactics of this amoeba-free St. John&rsquo;s thing, so he went over to the food carts at the town gates to open a dishwashing concession.&nbsp; He had a lot of customers at first, washing and reusing the foam plates, but after the third or fourth washing, customer&rsquo;s were not able to use the plate, and Southwick&rsquo;s business suffered.</p>

<p >Southwick is starting to do some ballsy weird shit.&nbsp; He talks to Ulysses, the street guy who looks like some fungal puff ball. &nbsp;Ulysses says: &ldquo;You are one of the few who remember my name, and bother to talk to me&rdquo; &mdash; And Southwick replies saying that &ldquo;I see you here on the street, and I want to see you here tomorrow, too.&nbsp; And the only way that happens is that you goddam make sure you stay alive so I can see you.&nbsp; Please take care of yourself.&rdquo; &nbsp;You too, [First Name].</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
