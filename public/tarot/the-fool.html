<p>ZZZZ--POP!  The fool appears. He has a look of surprise and confusion as he sets his [Dizzy:dog], down.  The pup races around, sniffs nearly everything and dances happily around his feet.</p>
<p>"What was that?  Oh, yeah, the [Contact:contact machines].  They always spin me around when I use them.  Kind of makes me feel like I have two left feet.  Where is this anyway?  Sure different here.  What a pretty flower."</p>
<p>He sits on an old log. He takes a moment to go through his belongings: the sword of confidence, the wand of capability, the pentacle of prosperity and the cup of integrity. His dog, Dizzy, sniffs his boots.  He continues: "I think I like this place. Hey Dizzy, I'm tired of thinking, anyway, and you sure like it here.  And that's just fine."</p>
<p>I'm here to find my way, learn new things.  If there is anything important, Dizzy, we will know it. And then I don't have to think about it anymore.  Maybe I can teach it to you.</p>
<p>Hmm. Can I teach a dog?  I can't teach dogs things like that! That's foolish.</p>
<p>Yes, well, that's who I am, and you <em>can</em> teach dogs all sorts of things.  And Dizzy, isn't your basic childhood dog, your real name is Discernment of the Highest Good.  At least thats what I was told.  I call you Discernment, or mostly, just Dizzy.  You are, well, a second body for me.  Like a cup waiting for me at nightfall.  And I will fill the cup, and we will move on as one again.</p>
<p>And the pup replied "Hey buddy, are you on crack?  You make no sense at all."</p>
<p>No, I'm the fool, and I do make sense, in fact, I only make sense, and let you do the thinking part.  Did you know I used to have a monkey?  It thought all the time and figured it was in charge, so I traded my monkey for you, Discernment. I lost my mind and came to my senses.  Later on, I'll teach you that you really are not a dog, but right now, it works out just fine.</p>
<p>And the dog replied: "I'm not a real dog? What the... That's what  I get for talking to a fool.  And not just any fool, This Fool of all Fools. I better watch this guy pretty closely, or we will both be killed."</p>
<p>Hey, wait, Dizzy, where are you going?  You'll get us lost, oh, look, what a good dog, you found a path.  Let's go see what is just ahead...</p></div><!--Sidebar--><div id="sidebar" class="four columns"><a href="showit">this is contents of sidebar</a></div></div></div></div><footer data-id="footer"></footer></body></html>
