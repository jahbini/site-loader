<p><em><strong>Our best fighters</strong></em> have fallen in battle.  Even in the midst of conflict we must honor the price that each has paid, and the losses we have endured.  Many are wounded and our only opportunity is retreat and recuperation.  Our doctors are tending them as best we can.  We gather around a small family service.  The son has died from his wounds, and is now laid in his full battle dress for his journey to his fighters reward as the heirophant has promised. May his death be worthy, our recovery rapid and our future bright. Inverted.  An unworthy loss.</p>

<h2>Page of Swords</h2>
<p><strong><em>The informer</em></strong>:  A young girl with huge curiosity, she peeks into every drawer, and looks into every purse. Here you see her eavesdropping at the confessional.  She looks and reports on any weakness for her king, but misleads any enemy.</p>
<h2>Knight of Swords</h2>
<p><em><strong>The soldier</strong></em> -- Whether it is with armor, sword, or garrote, Alexander "Ax" Blade is the guy who will get the job done.</p>
