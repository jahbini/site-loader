  Message: "<p>St. John's is lost.&nbsp; It was a vigorous area of Portland with mills, shops, shipping.&nbsp; And now, just the workers remain.&nbsp; Mostly in the bars.</p>\r\n<p>Too many of these unemployed workers around to make the real switch to a gentrified neighborhood -- continual reminders of poverty DO tend to make the gentry squeamish.</p>\r\n<p>And so St. John's waits in the gap between the past, and an uncertain future: the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo\">bardo</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">About me? -- &nbsp;I'm a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jhinds.411-source.com/\">programmer</a> by trade, and have a pretty good track record of completing projects and such.&nbsp; Doing innovative stuff, bla, bla, bla.&nbsp; But economically, It's a very different story. &nbsp;I owe a butt-load of money to the Man, and he got more than Dog working for him. &nbsp; So I'm forced to hunt for work: an uncertain future -- the bardo.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">But programming requires a meditation like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/community_posts/zen_and_art_computer_programming\">zen chess</a>. &nbsp;And worse, it steals time.&nbsp; Time, precious time that results in missing important things.&nbsp; Like packages have been left on your doorstep too long and have been returned to sender or that your house burned down.&nbsp; And worse: Zen Chess emits pheromones that just say NO to sex.&nbsp; Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be programmers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Ouch: lets try a balance: &nbsp;Zen Chess in the AM, and dedicate the PM to writing. Fiction, stories, real stuff, crazy stuff, St. John's stuff. &nbsp;That's the most fascinating: the stories from Saint John's residents. &nbsp;All I need to do is pay attention. &nbsp;The St. John's Lighthouse will illuminate as many stories as I can transcribe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">So here I am in St. John's, trying to fill the bardo by writing down all the stories that I'm running into.&nbsp; The people here are fascinating, and [First Name], here's one now: Gandalf is up at the counter:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Gandalf tells me: &quot;Next door to my house was an old lady in her 90's.&nbsp; She moved a few years ago to a nursing home. &nbsp; She sold to a couple of Mother Goddess worshippers who did some renovations and put a natural irrigation system in their back yard.&nbsp; Bingo!

  Subject: "The Kung Fu Lion's Roar"
  Message: "<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">(Writers Casebook:  OMG! the Roast Vegetable Bread Pudding gave my mouth incredible joy!  Thank you, James John Cafe -- may no one ever find out your secret location lest you run out of food. And you put up with my outbursts of laughter as I write.)</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">I love the movie <a href=\"http://www.sonypictures.net/movies/kungfuhustle/site/\" target=\"_blank\">Kung Fu Hustle</a>.  Every move was set up with the comedic timing of Laurel and Hardy as told to the Animaniacs and delivered in the abundant flavors of China.  The underlying culture is painted lovingly: a window that we westerner's can look through.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">I especially loved the weird moves and miracle cures.  One Kung-Fu move, The Lion's Roar, really stood out.  A shout so loud and terrible, that enemies can barely crawl away.  The number and effect of visual jokes built on <a href=\"http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=592\" target=\"_blank\">The Lion's Roa</a>r indicated it was more than just a gag.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">The Lion's Roar.  I can do that.  Really.  I have a voice so loud that thieves have fallen, dropped their booty and fled.  Like John Goodman's big brother erupted out of my throat.   A voice so powerful I put fear into Scottish Bagpipes.  When I unleash the Lion's Roar, I see stunned faces instead of enemies.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">A voice so powerful it can only be used for good or evil -- or something in between.  I have made a promise never to teach it to anyone unless they can cast a shadow. (shout really loud... louder...  No, MUCH louder...  No, not quite: keep trying) --   I guess that makes me a bleak belt in \"Lions Roar.\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">That's a bit unlike the real martial arts that are taught in St. John's.  We have both Western and Eastern styles:  <a href=\"http://fencingcenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fencing</a> for the West, <a href=\"http://www.ecoledebudo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aikido</a>, kung-fu, <a href=\"http://www.onewithheart.com/index.php?option=com_chronocontact&amp;Itemid=81\" target=\"_blank\">Poekoelan Tjimindie Tulen</a> from Indonesia on the East.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">I have been doing the Poekoelan thing since January.  It is a fabulous workout: I've lost 30 pounds and finally have abs. It is heavy into Eastern Mystic Tradition, but totally focussed on hand to anything combat.  Grab me by the hair?  Arm Lock?  Head Lock? Full Nelson?  Knife? Gun? There is a move for all that.  All the moves end in hospital visits for the attacker.  Can I do them?  No.  Heck, I can't even master \"falling down\" or it's more challenging vertical variant: \"Standing Up\".  But <em>they</em> can.  Proof?  Remember the Philippine-American war?  Our troops in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_martial_arts\" target=\"_blank\">Philippines</a>?  The hand-to-hand fighting was so intense that we resorted to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cure_(torture)#Philippine-American_War\" target=\"_blank\">extreme methods</a> (ugh! Teddy Roosevelt, say it ain't so! ) and invented a bigger <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911_pistol#Early_history_and_adoption\" target=\"_blank\">gun</a> to stop these 120 pound fighters who were armed only with sticks and yo-yos.  These guys bounce around like electrified chinese contortionists.  Only they control the electricity: <span style=\"color: #99cc00; \"><em><strong>Zap!</strong></em></span>  And you would think there would be more hubub about it. Poekoelan Tjimindie Tulen is <em>that</em> kind of combat art.  Let's not do any more land wars in S.E. Asia, OK?</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">But that's the interesting thing about Martial Arts.  You <em><strong>don't</strong></em> read about how gangs of well trained Martial Arts experts are devastating the thugs.  Thugs pretty much stay away from real trouble and don't like to be on the receiving end.   Absolutely none of the folks who take Poekoelan have mentioned the actual street fights they have had.  Mostly because the more you know, the less likely you are to use it.  It builds character quickly.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">The instructors are patient, supportive, competent and positive. Underprotected folk like women and children learn and understand the effect of these moves and become self-protected.  And that feeling of self protection is really needed for kids so they can mature well.  For the vulnerable, it is too easy for goals and values to be hijacked by peer-fear pressure if there is a lack of self-protection and self-capability.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">Poekoelan Tjimindie Tulen for self-protection and self-capability.  It's that good.  Until I get better at it, I'll rely on The Lion's Roar.  Scottish Bagpipes:  Beware! </p>"

  Message: "<p>&nbsp;Rain in St. John's.&nbsp; Sunday.&nbsp; I notice large numbers of kids dragging their parents through the rain to the movie theatre.&nbsp; I look at the Marque.&nbsp; &quot;The Network&quot; and &quot;JackAss 3&quot; -- I get all gooey inside when I think of the kids being interested in either.&nbsp; Of course, I get sympathy pains whenever Johnny Knoxville gets slammed in the nuts.&nbsp; Better him than me, he's a professional, I'm only an amateur jackass.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">Kids brains are fertile ground.

A few ads for junk food, maybe some paper airplanes, maybe some popcorn in the air, and then some seriously silly fun up on the screen.&nbsp; These kids aren't yet into networks or jackasses, families have enough to deal with as the blessed baby-asses they are still.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

from the James John Cafe.&nbsp; More souffle than pudding, this flavor grenade has a mix of textures to keep my tongue happy for the duration of the meal.&nbsp; Infinitely more satisfying than the vegan &quot;chicken breath soup&quot; that my ex used to serve.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">The district of St. John&rsquo;s is fertile ground.&nbsp;

&mdash; I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get any further information from Bambi: he spoke through tight lips, and I figured there was more to this.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;

His wife had died.&nbsp; He is the elder of the village, and he is asked for his opinion every night.&nbsp; And even if he rambles, all the village still listens.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #232323\">One morning he rises and asks for a horse.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;

His sons did that, and he never rode &quot;angry mane&quot; at all.&nbsp; Angry Mane was old too, but was the horse that the&nbsp; Old One wanted.&nbsp; Angry Mane died a few seasons back, and another was never really needed, since the&nbsp; Old One has not ridden a horse for 4 days of the &quot;dead Sun&quot; when the sun lies at the bottom of the sky, and only sacred magic of the Gods brings the sun back.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

Old One asks for a horse, the sons are deferential, and explain that &quot;angry mane&quot; is dead and that he can ride this new steed of fire.&nbsp; Even though the new steed is old and broken down: the gentlest ride in the tribe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

He fails repeatedly, and his sons give him a lift on to the back of the horse.&nbsp; He has the horse walk very slowly. &nbsp; And the women look on at this wise, old man acting so odd.&nbsp; And he becomes the topic of the morning.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

He asks: &quot;What is happening in our village that has all the ladies so chatty&quot; -- &quot;My Stallion, I must report that our elder has mounted a horse and is barely moving&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

Old One where is he going, and will he be back for the evening meal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Old One says that he must visit &quot;great night&quot; -- And the chief asks if the&nbsp; Old One knows the way, and the&nbsp; Old One thinks and nods: &quot;oh, yes, Gourd-Shaker knows, I need to have Gourd-Shaker guide me&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #232323;

Old One is to visit the land of great night. &nbsp; And Gourd-shaker says &quot;we need much preparation&quot;&nbsp; --&nbsp; For the tribal elder to visit the great night, the shaman wants to have a great festival.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

Old One and says:&nbsp; Gourd-Shaker wants 5 days to prepare your voyage, and we have many questions to ask you before you leave:&nbsp; And the&nbsp; Old One said that he would wait 5 days and nights, and answer all the tribes questions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

And a fire was built that was bigger than usual, and was to be well stocked with fuel for five full days, and it would channel the source of wisdom for the&nbsp; Old One, but Gourd-Shaker was strong in his statement that it must burn day and night for the full five days.&nbsp; And wood was gathered that would last for five days.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #232323; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #232323\">The preparations over, the evening settled in, and the chief spoke: &quot;we are here to give the elder a journey to great night, we will Give Him What He Needs to make that journey.&nbsp; And in return, he will answer all the questions that you ask:&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #232323; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

The Chief asked the&nbsp; Old One again if he was going to great night, and the&nbsp; Old One said &quot;Yes, the time is near when I visit great night&quot;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

Gourd-Shaker said that you can only ride a horse part-way to great night.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Old One said that he knew that too, but did not know what other transportation was needed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

The night gods come down when called and visit night god valley. &nbsp; We are going there now, and you will summon the night gods.&nbsp; We will be there by noon tomorrow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

As few of the tribe lived long enough to visit great night directly.&nbsp; Most died peacefully in their sleep, in battle, or by accident -- Those were burned to send to them to the great night.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

It was a great boon and meant that the&nbsp; Old One was indeed in touch with the sprits.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #232323;

Yes.&nbsp; A king is more a &lsquo;function&rsquo; than a sex thing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what you do and why you do it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

They create opportunities for other businesses &mdash; other kings and kingdoms.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s part of the synergy of the pentacles: why they are so important.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

Kings know, find and create&nbsp; <em><strong>&lsquo;er</strong></em>&nbsp; &mdash; that&rsquo;s what Kings do.&nbsp; The actual&nbsp;<em><strong>Git done</strong></em>&nbsp;part is the domain of the Knights and Pages of Pentacles. &nbsp;

From a Tarot standpoint, let&rsquo;s just say that the Knights are the core workers and hands-on managers, and the Pages are sales, marketing, administration. &nbsp; The King knows the space.&nbsp; Knows it very well. &nbsp;The King owns the space. &nbsp;If the space is &nbsp;perfume, he knows perfume. &nbsp;If it's baking, he knows baking. &nbsp;If it's rocket science, he knows the tech, and keeps his cool during launch and knows what his people are telling him: A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSFYc40c08\">misfire</a> is worse than a no-fire.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

That&rsquo;s her.&nbsp; Neither Randy or Hamid or anyone hate Throntle, or really look down on her (well, maybe a little bit) but if she behaved (even a little bit!), she&rsquo;d be welcome.&nbsp; Like the wise say: &ldquo;Heroin isn&rsquo;t for everybody.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

is the PERFECT name for a hot winter signature drink, Hamid thinks seriously and takes his time. &nbsp;More to figure out how to reel me in to sanity and not to make an actual decision.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

He just says Jesus does it. &nbsp;I think Jesus Connection is there, too. &nbsp;But if you ask him about a decision?&nbsp; Get him to slow down?&nbsp; Yes, he too, can explain in simple terms why and how a choice was made. &nbsp;Same thing with Suzanne&rsquo;s cafe.&nbsp; Practical.&nbsp; Goal directed.&nbsp; Knowledgeable.&nbsp; Aware.&nbsp; Effective.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">When a king has not got that ability to relate to his Tarot Queen (The business itself &mdash; Just think that the king is married to the kingdom), the Knights, (the workers) and the Pages (eyes and ears), the kingdom does not thrive, and dwindles.&nbsp; Dumas had great fun commenting on the French Royalty&rsquo;s difficult history.&nbsp; But Louis the 16th wasn&rsquo;t the only king to lose touch with the essentials of his job.&nbsp; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSFYc40c08\">A misfire is worse than a no-fire.</a></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

Kings are mature, and comfortable with being Practical, Goal Directed, Knowledgeable, Aware and Effective.&nbsp; Because business is business.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">But when one of those essential elements is missing: being Aware, Knowledgeable.&nbsp; Not recognizing practicality. You name it. Then it&rsquo;s French Revolution time, or &ldquo;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=Lord+save+us+from+the+wrath+of+the+Viking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Lord save us from the wrath of the Vikings</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=bankruptcy+rise&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">there isn&rsquo;t much call for buggy-whips anymore</a>&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">When it comes to business, it takes a king to make king sized decisions with king sized consequences: a King of Pentacles. &nbsp;You now have an idea of what a King must do and why.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">What do you want on your Tombstone? &nbsp;Put this one on mine: &quot;He had a pleasant thought as he went into the light&quot; -- and he &quot;never accepted money from amoebas!&quot;</p>"

(Author's note: Southwick dishes me this great stuff for a budding writer.  I love it.)</p>\n<h3>Roger</h3>\n<p>Roger is the Navy guy.  Navy Retired.  Quartz crystal on-time no nonsense enlisted background.  After that he worked AGAIN and got a full retirement from a Portland ironwork.  If Roger does something, you know it's totally A-OK  (except for the divorce thing.) Mr. no-problem seldom complaining, but often griping.  His life is OK, but he wonders about the competence of people he has to deal with.  Don’t we all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roger has a PhD in Preventative Maintanence from the school of hard knox, and is working on a second on-line PhD in <em>minding your own business</em>.  Southwick says most of Roger's class material kind of looks like Tetris or something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"> </span></p>\n<h3>Tommy</h3>\n<p>Tommy is an interesting guy.  We can only wonder about his early years.  Swarthy, a bit like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/images?rls=en&amp;q=stromboli+pinocchio&amp;oe=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">Stromboli</a>, but with a nordic last name.  Raised mostly in New Jersey, but somehow brought out to Portland by Geppetto, who sold his woodcarving business and bought  quite a LOT of land here.  High priced industrial land.  Or, at least that's the fog that Tommy puts out.  Blustery about even very small things out of place.  Snores like a razorback in rut.  Tommy is an excellent mechanic, loves to take anything apart, but only can put barges, ships, cars and engines back together.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tommy is a professor of workplace ethics for Waterfront U.  Mostly there are none.  Ethics, that is.  He holds the coveted “Mouthpiece” chair.<span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Wanda</h3>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Arial\">Wanda.  Very young, trying to train to be a medical clerk without much help in life.  Hard childhood as an after-thought latchkey, foster kid.  Red hair, tolerable smart but not very pretty, slightly anorexic, no clue about the wider world, very reactive verbally, but also very guarded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wanda is getting a B.S. in tactical retaliation.  Her early work is very promising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Arial; \"><span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/></span>Wanda left Tommy in May or so.  Since then they have been playing some petty games with each other. She wants to milk Tommy for things like car repairs.  Tommy wants to lure her back to his bed with a big pocketbook that is just out of her reach.   <span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/><br/></span>Tommy has steamed and seethed.  Losing Wanda hit him hard: he wanted to be the stallion that could tame a 21 year old.  Mostly quiet recently but then, one night at 10:30PM, Wanda is <span style=\"font-size: large; \"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>pounding</strong></em></span></span> on the front door.  She wants Tommy to come out to talk.  Tommy is hiding in the dark in his bedroom.  He's murmuring \"tell her to go away, I'll call the cops.\"  She pounds away for another 15 minutes.  She walks away shouting threats that would freeze the heart of Capn Ahab.<span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/><br/></span>This morning, Tommy leaves early, putting up a note to Roger saying: \"Call me ASAP\" -- Agitated Roger is cooking his breakfast, and turns to Southwick: \"Is it OK to VENT?\"  -- He says “Sure.”  (Southwick knows I’m a sucker for an interesting story, and this one is devine! )<span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/></span>It seems that Tommy snooped around on FaceList or CraigBook or somewhat and found an ad for a request for a threesome from Wanda and her new boyfriend, Carl.  The pictures on the ad had blanked out faces, but Tommy had the original picture (?) and put that in an e-mail with the link to the offending ad. Then Tommy sent that out to all of Wanda's and Carl's friends and relatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A dirty, filthy trick.  No wonder Tommy wanted to hide.<span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\"><br/><br/></span>Well...   It gets more fun.  It seems that when Wanda left Tommy, she had the admin passwords to Tommy's computer!!!!  Tommy has his remote administration feature turned on, but to Tommy, that's like saying \"<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=%22boff+noff+toff+roff%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\">Boff Noff Toff Roff</a>\" -- meaningless.  Wanda gave the passwords to Carl, who is Windows savvy, and farkeled Tommy's computer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tommy wants to call the FBI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Arial\">Roger and Southwick’s gab-fest is cut short as Tommy arrives:  \"Have the Police been here yet?\"</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Arial\"><span style=\"font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'\">At this point, </span>Roger is steamed up because he's friends with all the players.   Been friends with them for years.  In fact, Carl is the son of Roger's best friend. Wanda has known Roger since she was 7 and confides in him like a grandfather.  She calls him \"Gramps\" -- All her <em>friends</em> call him \"Gramps.\"   And all the players in this crap-opera are pushing him to act as go-between and such which pisses Roger off!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is all cutting into Roger's class participation in his on-line PhD in “Minding Your Own Business.”  Shit, if he doesn’t get a good grade, he will have to pay back that Student Loan for all his hours of on-line Poker. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Arial\"><em>More to follow soon!!!</em></p>"

  Subject: "The Cougar's Secret Identity"
  Message: "<p>The lecture hall is small, maybe 70 seats, but the audience of high-level decision makers is riveted to Thereasa as she speaks.</p>\n<p>Her paper, “Demonstration of Control of DNA Augmented Chimerea”  is part of NonSaneO’s briefing for a select group of high level officials on “Arachno-Mamalian DNA augmentation.”  She finishes her talk in the manner she starts: Riding on the thorax of a Grizzly Bear with 8 legs and the head of a spider.</p>\n<p>Her control is unique:  She vibes into the energy flows of the giant bug with her hands.  Kneading, massaging, humming and kissing, she programs a pattern of behavior into it’s mind.  Kind of like changing the kind of web the thing spins.</p>\n<p>She says “Web making behavior is so primitive that it is be stored like knitting instructions in the thing’s DNA.  By massaging, and stroking, I direct the expression of a single step of action: making a single long thread, or making a spoke of the web.  I am able to string these commands together so that the bug seems to have intelligence as it carries out my needs.”</p>\n<p>“I reasoned, correctly, that if bees dance to convey messages to other bees in the hive, the more solitary spider would need actual physical contact to get her DNA activations to work.  Truly, the commands are only accepted when the mammalian psyche of the chimera is in a near orgasm state.  Otherwise, it exerts too much control over the organism’s behavior for reprogramming to be effective.”</p>\n<p>Thereasa’s gifts of her charismatic presence, intense emotion, inquiring intellect, hands of genius and ability to kiss ookie giant bugs on their weird bug-eyes makes her a unique asset to NonSaneO’s program.</p>\n<p>Thereasa answers the questions that she knew would come: “Ms. Qugaré, can you teach your techniques?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, of course, I can teach — are you ready to learn?” The congressman quickly lowers his hand. “We lack volunteers to take on this task.  I am in the early stages of training one subject:  Here is a video of Steven commanding the bat-spinners to perform useful work in hazardous environments.”</p>\n<p>The video shows a man with two bat-spinners: he is waving his fingers mysteriously as the bats spin webs around a cake box: finally they fly straight up, each pulling on a thread of spider silk and finally hang it on a tree branch several hundred feet above ground.</p>\n<p>“Note that each of these bat-spinners is attached with a web strand to Steven’s hand.  Steven is able to control each movement explicitly.  Unfortunately, the bat-spinners need constant stimulus.  Foreplay, if you will, and Steven often rushes through that.”  She speaks with a bit of matter-of-fact realization that Steven would never really “get it.”</p>\n<p>Thereasa Qugaré finishes her talk with the usual request for more funding for more research, but secretly she is quite happy with the current state of NonSaneToe’s decision makers. They want to create the perfect worker, but are too scared to let the secret of these horrors out of the lab.  So far, Thereasa is the only human that can control the things.</p>\n<p>At the luncheon afterwards, she catches the eye of a Federal Judge.  She enjoys the flirt and thinks that more friends in high places is a good thing.  “Do you know Justice [First Name] Bender?” she asks.  “Yes, as a matter of fact, [fbgender] spoke of you in rather positive terms.”  I’ll bet, she thinks.</p>\n<p>Just as she is ready to make an evening connection, her phone rings: “This is Detective Tamworth of the Portland Police Department.  Am I speaking with Thereasa Koogray?”</p>\n<p>Thereasa — “Yes. This is Thereasa Qugaré.  What is this about?”</p>\n<p>Tamworth — “A Mr Steven Boitoi has been reported missing, and we would like to speak with you.”  Thereasa’s blood turns cold.  Something happened to Steven.  All her spinners back at her treetop ranch in Forest Park would get loose!</p>\n<p>“I am at a conference in Chicago, I will return immediately and speak with you Monday.  Yes, 10AM.”</p>\n<p>Next: [TCreturn:The Cougar Returns]! </p>"

  Message: "<p>[First Name], the City Council had their annual Parade of the Passions to kick off the holiday celebrations.&nbsp; Yup, already, the &ldquo;Passion Partners&rdquo; are presiding over meetings to make Christmas decorations all over St. John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Maxine Power, wearing a button reading: &ldquo;consensus uber alles,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Passion Partners are certified in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_Ratched\">enhanced persuasion</a> techniques such as Political Correctness Boarding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She assured me that the City Council knows what it needs: They have consensus.&nbsp; After spending a cordial five minutes in her presence, I went outside and begged Throntle for her needle.&nbsp; Consensus is a gateway drug.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px;

Roger likes the display at the BBird Tavern.&nbsp; It has been the same Christmas Display all year.&nbsp; The owner never has to re-paint it.&nbsp; Tommy plots to topple the Christmas tree made of beer cans over at the corner store.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;

&mdash; it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://grammyandnonnastoys.com/\">Grammy and Nonna's</a> toy store.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m not really into toys much, but these are the backbone toys for a great childhood.&nbsp;

I had to &ldquo;tap-out&rdquo; from Sandy&rsquo;s Dumpster Dojo and called in Southwick to consult the Akashic records.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px;

&ldquo;GotADollar?&rdquo; &ldquo;WhatAreYouLookingAt&rdquo; f</em>or a few minutes and then goes all trance like.&nbsp; His eyes roll like Elmo.&nbsp; He speaks:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px;

Boom. The emotion was too hard to handle for this guy and he exploded.&nbsp; Even good memories can be too strong when they come on all at once.&nbsp; The combined effect of remembered childhood hope slammed into the concrete wall of eternal street life without the safety valve of possibility can muck up your whole day.&nbsp; Yup. Spontaneous Human combustion.&nbsp; Happens all the time to drunks.&nbsp; You should be glad he took his legs with him.&nbsp; Usually the feet are left behind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">I know everybody has been asking what happened to the window, so you heard it first on the St. John&rsquo;s Lighthouse.&nbsp; The akashic records do not lie.</p>"

Even when I mentioned that getting a modern printer to work with these old machines was met with the response:&nbsp; There are plenty of free printers at the Church.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Last week Jug was pretty unhappy.&nbsp; The recipes are piling up.&nbsp; Dammit Jim, I want these recipes.&nbsp; Will you help me get DBase II working or not? &nbsp; I replied that I&rsquo;m happy to provide as much or as little help as Jug needs.&nbsp; A hobby is a hobby.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">But last week I asked Jug what was important here. &nbsp;Was it to get his recipes on-line? Or were old-time computers the hobby?&nbsp; Was his mission to Free the DBase Two at the end of chapter 21 the big goal? Jug is at chapter 6 now: one chapter a month is pretty good for an old beast like this, but it&rsquo;s really bad if he wants recipes.&nbsp; He replied that he was able to do it inexpensively because the program was FREE, and the one on the internet was complicated and cost $50.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">And then I asked him to add up his time and he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Right.&nbsp; <strong><em>Money!</em></strong>&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; and then a strange thing happened.&nbsp; Jug stopped for a moment and said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&nbsp; Even if I forget the money, I want it to WORK! My way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">I said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Thats OK.&nbsp; You get to pick your goal and I&rsquo;m happy to help, but you don&rsquo;t seem to be enjoying this.&nbsp; If the payoff from this is only a working recipe program and the expense is your enjoyment of your life, that may not be the balance you want.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like trying to get a small advantage in traffic and getting all steamed up at the loss of some tiny ego-centered goal.&nbsp; It is better to pick goals that give a bigger payoff with less hassle.&nbsp; Work up to more complicated slowly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Then, Jug said &ldquo;Fuck the DBase Two.&nbsp; Let them rot in their prison.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Today I saw Jug on the street:&nbsp; I said &ldquo;Hi Jug, Howzit!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">He said: &ldquo;See, I got a Jug!&nbsp; By the way, I&rsquo;m using that recipe program from the internet. Works fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica\">Every time I see him he says &ldquo;got a jug&rdquo; or &ldquo;see, no jug&rdquo; &mdash; He explains that is how he keeps his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut\">Jug-or-Not </a>nickname.&nbsp; I agree, being in control of the nicknames people have for you is a good thing, Yes?.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010"
  Message: "<p>St. John&rsquo;s has come to life this last weekend &mdash; Parties, Open houses, decorations, carolers in top hats and tiaras. And the red cape, [First Name], popped a few eyes. Elegance now comes in Thai-hot.</p>\r\n<p>Even in Tommy, OR the fun is Thai hot. It seems SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010 involves lots of calls at 2 and 3 AM.</p>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; \">\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">&ldquo;NO! She&rsquo;s a Wack Job. No, she isn&rsquo;t here. &hellip; No, a Wack Job, a WACK JOB. I don&rsquo;t take her calls anymore. Tell her to stop texting me.&rdquo; and &ldquo;What bar are you at? You weren&rsquo;t supposed to be out of Jail until Thursday. She said that? You better be gone by the time I get there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Of course Tommy never really went to the bar, that&rsquo;s not his style. He is a master of keeping the drama going even while he spins the chnnel selector on the TV. &nbsp;He multi-tasks.</p>\r\n<p>I have recently commissioned a logo &mdash; my stuff is notoriously deficient in graphics. When I looked at it, it had all the right elements, the artist was faithful to my intent, but&hellip;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Tommy usually has one or two of these triangles going. For&nbsp;SeasonsGreetingFest 2010&nbsp;he is spinning these things like the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhoos1oY404\">plate guy</a>&nbsp;on Ed Sullivan. Tommy&rsquo;s only rule is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fish off the company pier&rdquo; &mdash; Any other pier? Go for it!&nbsp;Tommy is feeling the merry making Spirit of the Season.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Tommy's rule: Just make sure it is at least 10% true otherwise his conscience bothers him. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px; \">Actually Tommy&rsquo;s conscience does not ever really bother him. He may not win every battle, and is sometimes the one to come out with a bruise or two, but he can not imagine a world where this kind of competition and pettiness does not exist. &nbsp;He is who he is, in the world he sees.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">And since it is the season of giving, Tommy wants to share his true feelings with everyone: misery. Tommy says: &quot;If it's at&nbsp;least 10% true, try it and fly it&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>In the logo I look like Casper -- ghostly. 0xfff in HTML slang. Pallid to the point of potash. Life-drained. I was not sure at first, so Southwick did a time-displaced mind meld at the meme level by bouncing sub-molecular vibrations off of objects in space.</p>\r\n<p>The e-mail reply from the cat-goddess was: &nbsp;&quot;Nailed It!&quot; &nbsp;-- Accurate feedback is to be rewarded. To both artist and feline-fatale I bid you refresh yourself with a bubble bath and a cigar. Thank you. Your&nbsp;consciences remain clean.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Roger&rsquo;s conscience, on the other hand, will improve as he laboriously untangles himself from Tommy&rsquo;s innuendos. Tommy started rumors that Roger got out the snow shovel so that Tommy&rsquo;s old fiance could steal it. We wish Roger a grand holiday and quiet future in his new home on the charismatic Oregon Coast. Roger&rsquo;s true feelings: weariness. Roger says: &ldquo;Ya think?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Southwick&rsquo;s conscience is pretty good. Willful acts of moon are not willful acts of evil. Southwick&rsquo;s true feelings: myopic optimism. Southwick says: &ldquo;Who said the dick was the first to go?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s High Noon and I&rsquo;m declaring war on pallid. &nbsp;OK, pallid, I&rsquo;m growing a beard.</p>\r\n<p>St. John's Christmas tree trimming saw non-pallid crowd pleaser, Orion Guimond, organize a children's Christmas tree trimming under the Mayor's watchful eye. &nbsp;Both the Mayor and Orion's children's army enjoyed the moment. &nbsp;The first week of SeasonsGreetingsFest 2010 went very well in St. John's.</p>\r\n<p>St. John's merchant's true feelings: optimistic.</p>\r\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p>The first signs of my beard is that it is completely white. Now I&rsquo;ll be casper the fuzzy ghost. Crap.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kingsporch.jpg\">tattoo on a beard</a>. Yeah. Sure.</p>\r\n<p>How&rsquo;s that to give you Myopia of the Optimism?</p>\r\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n</div>"

  Subject: "Scene 3, Nobrow and Throntle"
  Message: "<p>Nobrow is a pretty cool guy.  When it comes to hassle, nasty, or emotions, you might say that he does a very good job of keeping upwind.</p>\n<p>Nobrow lives in a shack near a fertilizer warehouse that is mostly smell free.  It’s big for one, and Uni has a deal with the watchman to let him know if they are going to need to open the gates.  Even pays “rent”.</p>\n<p>There’s no worry about that for Nobrow: Fertilizer is a zero dollar commodity till spring, and Nobrow can have as much as he wants.  Nobody is going to bother much.  Like I say, he keeps upwind.</p>\n<p>Now that it’s christmas,  U is going to take the trek to visit relatives nearly as poor as he is, but his family roots are strong.  They know he’s poor, he knows they are poor -- So what, they lived in tents many times and pretty much like it.  Don’t really like to be “inside”.  Smells funny.</p>\n<p>For all the normal reasons that we live far or near our parents it is the same if you are poor or rich: as above, so below.  Luckily, Nobrow had gotten the bus money together from a stint as a guard at a couple of week end concerts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Nobrow's survival tip: The can picking pays the food and rent, but the guard job pays for beer and Greyhound tickets.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nobrow was looking forward to seeing his brother, newly released after five years.  It was unclear if Fred would show up, but Nobrow would love to reconnect, even if it was only a brotherly punch.</p>\n<p>He had gotten paid, bought the ticket, and had a “date” with his hooker girl friend.  The one he loves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, Throntle, the poop-smearing champ of Tommy, OR.  In the final, she outpaced 20 contestants by defacing more vehicles with the regulation trashcan contents of 7 empty cans of IceHouse and 14 McDonalds wrappers (McDonalds wrappers are a gift of the corporation at no cost available at a dumpster near you).  Ah, the power of pure heroin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In another note, the exact same contents are available to the Tommy, OR hooker reclamation project, let's hope the project makes better use of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that Nobrow gave $20 to Throntle,  He really is her source of last resort.  He does keep upwind, but remember he lives at the fertilizer warehouse.  Still, he was leaving in a few days, and for what ever reason, he gave in to her and she slipped it into her pocket.  Nobrow went away feeling he had been used, and she, in her dotty state, misplaced the $20, and thought he had tricked her.</p>\n<p>For the next hour, Throntle paced the streets of St. John’s, cursing Nobrow for stealing her $20, and covering his tiny shed with all the fun things she could find near a fertilizer warehouse. Not long after, Nobrow and Throntle had an angry meeting, he suggested that she look in her back pocket.   Finding her money, she kind of faded out sight real quick knowing that Nobrow will know <em>she</em> trashed his shack.</p>\n<p>Nobrow is angry when he sees his place, but cleans it up the hassle.  That's last night, by morning today, he is chuckling, forever the charismatic “good guy” heavy that we recognize in “<a href=\"http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2924\" target=\"_blank\">joe palooka</a>.”</p>\n<p>As Nobrow leaves on his Christmas trek this afternoon, he tells me “If you see Throntle, tell her I’m not angry.\"  He chuckles at the fiasco: \"I can’t be mad at her, she’s just crazy and does stuff like that.  I love her.  I’d like to see her before I go.”</p>\n<p>Yes, Uni has very strong connections.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I, St. John's Jim, have seen this with my own eyes, and yes: Love is un-fucking-believable.</p>\n</blockquote>"

  Subject: "Kiting over to WikiLeaks with one jaw tied behind "
  Message: "<p> I had an appointment this day for more dental work.  I have heard that dentists are suffering because people’s teeth have fewer cavities nowadays.  As a response, dental research has found that the optimum number of teeth is 128 instead of 32.  Clone research is very close to a breakthrough on this topic.  Economic research says that four times more teeth will boost profit after taxes by 326% — expect more teeth than you ever thought possible coming to a mouth near your tongue.</p>\n<p>Seriously, the kid does good work.  A craftsman in training.  First he made a kite, maybe 100 foot across, and wired my jaw to it.   Starting the wind machine, my jaw kind of sailed into the clouds with me suspended a few feet below.  Remember that Dentistry was the third cousin to Benjamin Franklin.  Sailing into the clouds makes it likely that lightning will strike, thus slightly numbing my mouth.  After the third lightning strike, he declared that if I walk into the light, he will have my new mouth waiting on the other end.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I walked into the light, removed my shoes and belt, put all my belongings into a gray plastic tray, and the pilot said: “We are now in a holding pattern over O’hare Airport.

Maybe you better check that leaky plumbing.”</p>\n<p>Tommy replied:  “Ummm. Yeah.  Insurance won’t pay for that.”</p>\n<p>Roger said: “Yeah, simple things, just below the surface.  Fix ‘em first.

  Subject: "Invoking the Muse"
  Message: "<p>[First Name], a tradition in literature reaches back thousands of years, likely longer.  It touches on old ideas regarding creativity and deity.  The ideas that only a god could be truly creative, and man was only creative when channelling a spirit.</p>\n<p>Totally bogus, of course, but in this modern age, we keep the tradition as a tribute to times past, and sometimes, because it just might be useful.  Read on.</p>\n<p>Grecian works tended to start with a prayer as part of the text.  The formal name of this prayer is the “<a href=\"http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Muse.html\" target=\"_blank\">Invocation to the Muse</a>,” For example, The Illiad starts off with words like: “Sing goddess, of the wrath of Peleus’ son Achilles…”</p>\n<p>— But the goddess is pissed today.  She wants more than a passing nod.  She put it bluntly to me the other day: “It’s Narrative Imagination. — No Narritive, No Imagination.  You piss me off, and I’ll make your head so blank you’ll only be good for proofreading.

  Subject: "Mind Boggling"
  Message: "<p>OK, my Dancing Water Amiga from Niagara Falls, I accept your mind-boggling challenge to make this offering funny. &nbsp;Well, at least I tried. &nbsp;(to my other readers, I do accept challenges. ) BTW, this is one of those interleaved stories, &nbsp;a bit harder to read without HTML, but, well, it's less cryptic than the Bible.</p>\r\n<p>I got lucky when I was a kid and saw something mind boggling.  It&rsquo;s not fun getting your mind boggled, and it might boggle yours, but Xin Loi Bah.  Sorry bout that.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--How valuable is my life?  I put a pretty high price on it.  I&rsquo;ll defend it to the gutter &mdash; and Beyond!!!  But that&rsquo;s not how valuable a life really is.  Not by how much turf I can defend, but how much I can contribute.</p>\r\n<p>I have witnessed living heart animal sacrifice.  I did summer intern stuff at the Mayo Clinic &mdash; the world famous medical research center in the early 1970&rsquo;s &mdash; state of the art in every way.<br />\r\nThe scientists there knew every aspect of the medical arts and computer sciences required to do what they had in mind.  And it required something that was mind boggling from beginning to end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--Well, I have contributed about 3 zillion exhales, 4.275 billion poops, 3.8 million zits, and maybe a few billions farts, take a belch or two.</p>\r\n<p>They brought the subject into the room.  a downcast, docile dog.  Not hugely responsive.  This dog was never rewarded much, and likely recieved only &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; but not quality care.  It had been purchased from the humane society and made physically healthy.  And respected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--So far, I have not contributed so much.  Except for the Alien Abductions.  These are not from some mothership above, but from a great fungal intelligence from the suberranean depths.  <strong><em>Mycotroxilus sapiensis</em></strong> &mdash; the spawn of Illuminium.</p>\r\n<p>The dog was caressed, stroked, voices were soft and reassuring.  A needle. In five seconds the dog became limp in the Vet&rsquo;s reassuring arms.  Soft, fast, loving, final.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--I contribute to&nbsp;Illuminium&nbsp;each night as the fungal threads come out of the walls and attach themselves to my hair follicles.  Each one is a relay to the mother nodes far under the PNW.  The three main nodes of&nbsp;Illuminium's&nbsp; primordial intelligence come together at the juncture of the Willamette and Columbia.</p>\r\n<p>A buzzing, electric hand-plow cut quickly and accurately into the animal &mdash; dodging all critical organs and retrieving the secret source of reliability of the animal kingdom.  The heart.</p>\r\n<p>The heart quickly retrieved, chilled, re-plumbed with surgical tubing became the center stage attraction on a Pre-Mayan scaffold to hold the living, beating heart in the harsh x-ray beams of computer sensors of the day. &nbsp;The heart's drain pipes sprouting from the dog's body like a borg telephone switchboard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--&nbsp;Illuminium's&nbsp;probes reveal secret information to Mycotroxius &mdash; how shall nature and Gaia cope with humanity?  An urgent question for the Mycotrosilus sapiensis &mdash;  intelligent for time before the first ice age.</p>\r\n<p>The heart lasted anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple of hours.  I can&rsquo;t remember.  I was running the data acquisition part and was barely able to keep up with the images.  They would be used for software I was to write and use during my summer there.  I was computer fodder in 1971.  Eager to be on the front lines and willing to be a part of the computer revolution</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--For some reason, I feel that these probes are valuable to insure the propogation of human lice. It's my contribution. &nbsp;Mind boggling. &nbsp;I may help advance lice for the benefit of fungus everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>The pup&rsquo;s heart gets incredibly damaged with repeated X-rays.  The dog had no chance of survival.  Thank you, you have given us much.  Your life is a stepping stone in man&rsquo;s evolution that we earnestly hope will never be trod on again.   You contributed to Computer Aided Tomography - CAT scans.  The same stuff used in ultrasound images.  One of the most incredible advances in medical technology.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">--I feel honored to be a part of the big scheme.</p>\r\n<p>Mind Boggling, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>"

  Subject: "Gard Rales here"
  Message: "<blockquote>\n<p>There is a national shortage of metals.  Well, not really a shortage, but the cost of copper or aluminum is very high and counties are needing to replace guard rails that have been stolen for the resale value of the metal.  This is a look behind the scenes at an amazing sub-culture built up around the guard rail craze of 2010.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Pickup is parked on the shoulder of the unpaved road.  A bad place to be in this rain.  Short of AAA, this truck isn’t going anywhere until the ground dries out.  A plywood slab is propped up on the cab reading: “Gard Rales here” with an arrow pointing off to the right.</p>\n<p>The long aluminum highway railing lay way over on the side.  The aluminum never moved during the daytime.  That was one of Roy Rales rules.</p>\n<p>I walked over to the RV that was parked a couple of hundred feet back on a vacant lot.  The rain pelted the awning like a slow drone for the slow guitar tunes coming from the player on the card table.  The old man sitting there looked relaxed and smiled as I approached:</p>\n<p>\"You lookin for Rales?\"</p>\n<p>I replied, “Yes, I’m St. John’s Jim, Are you Roy? We talked a couple of days ago?”</p>\n<p>The old man brightened and stood up.  Crossing over he took my hand and asked me to sit.  I explained my writing assignment to him again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m to get the inside info on the Aluminum black market.  You know, the human angle: Serious Journalism for the Portland Boffo.  Or maybe the Portland Lighthouse if the Boffo rejects it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He started talking with hardly any prompting, he stopped once or twice to cue up a delta guitar tune.</p>\n<p>“Everybody wants to know how lucrative the business is.  We don’t like the term “recycling” or “theft” we prefer to call ourselves “re-swipers,”  we do it because it’s fun.  Not because there is lots of money in it.  There really isn’t.  We barely keep our heads above water --  We keep under the radar.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He laughed: “Yee-haa-aha.  above water, under radar, Yee-haa-aha.”  I laugh with him, nervously. I don't want to encourage him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He stops in mid-sentance:  “Listen to this.”  He plays a bit with the music, closes his eyes and his fingers dance like metronomes to the slow twisty paths of the string chorus of a favorite tune.</p>\n<p>I wait, He punctuates the song with “Here it comes…  Now!” or “Listen…  Did you hear that?”  I nod in silence.  The tune is over, and He looks up and continues:</p>\n<p>“We keep under the radar.  We only take a bit at a time.  We keep under the limits of the maintenance budget of the county.  That way, the funds are already allocated, and they need to spend the money anyway.  If we don’t take the rails, then somebody will.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I explained that as a journalist, I was not interested in the ethics or legality of his “recycling” business, but he did give me a “reswipe local, fence local” button and a flier printed by the Church of Who Gives a Fuck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I finally asked the tough question: “All over the country, there are people stealing guard rails.”  He stops me with a reminder: “call us re-swipers, friend.”</p>\n<p>I continue: “Yes, re-swipers, and it’s a national problem.  But all over the country, these people call you Gard Rales,  You are known everywhere,  How did you get to be so famous?”</p>\n<p>Roy answered: “Well you can see it isn’t the rails” - He pointed over to 5 rails lying in the grass.  “Those are 45 foot sections.  We can only have five of them at a time.  That’s the rate for this county.  Any more, and we would get pinched, sure.  And that’s chicken feed.  Can't hardly have a family on that kind of income.”</p>\n<p>“So, instead, I wrote a rule book for re-swiping meets.  As long as you have your five sections re-swiped each 90 days, you can enter a team.  Teams compete to strip a stretch of railings from a regulation track.\"</p>\n<p>\"My favorite event is the drive-by -- The team has to hold the guard rail perfectly still in their hands at the side of the road so a cop passing by can't tell it has been unbolted. Six minutes is the record.  Ten minutes if there are K-9's in the cop car.\"</p>\n<p>\"The final event is called the chain-gang where a team has to whack up a guard rail into 18 in sections in the quickest time.  The crowd goes wild!\"</p>\n<p>\"The attendance for these events is up in hundreds already and I have a judging circuit that is turning pretty damn lucrative.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I did a follow-up interview three months later.  The truck and sign were sagging a bit more, and moss was growing around the edges of the painted letters.  The RV was new.  Very new.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Roy greeted me at the same card table.  His fingers still make metronome movements to the blues guitar music.</p>\n<p>There were a few differences.  There was a make-up artist working on Roy and a helicopter was idling in front of the RV.</p>\n<p>Roy said \"Ever since We started our 24 hour re-swiping network, we have had TV crews in and out of here.  In fact, I’m scheduled for a flight to Referee at the big Swipe Meet in January.”</p>\n<p>Re-swiping, is it the new American Pastime?</p>"

  Message: "<h3 style=\"text-align: center; \">From the Famed GutBuster Institute of The St. John&rsquo;s Infirmary</h3>\r\n<h4>&mdash;&nbsp;For immediate release</h4>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDr. Bernard Gutbuster announced success with retraining the emotional responses of hardened criminals.  In a measure of prisonyard violence at the Big Rock Men's Prison, the volunteers in his gut retraining regimen eliminated their rate of violent interaction with other inmates from 80 to 100 percent.  In fact, the subjects that did were involved in breaking up a prison yard altercation, not instigation.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Gutbuster&rsquo;s technique involves intense sensory and dietary practices on an infants four hour interval to re-train the emotional responses of the subjects through the intestinal neural ganglia &mdash; the gut level response.  Dr. Gutbuster has analyzed the 120 basic nutrition based emotional and functional responses that are learned through successful mother to baby interactions.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Gutbuster&rsquo;s early success were adapting cats to adapt the diet of the common squirrel.  Somebody thought it was seriously wrong to have cats eat acorns and so Dr. Gutbuster adapted the squirrel to have the dietary needs of cats.  Dr. Gutbuster went on record as saying &ldquo;While there have been examples of birds killed by meat eating squirrels, this killer squirrel thing is blown way out of proportion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Dr. Gutbuster&rsquo;s researches have been funded by the Big Rock Candy Burger Foundation, and so far, the only side effect is a strong preference shown by the volunteers for Big Rock Burgers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">-- While Dr. Gutbuster may come up with an artificial infancy, don&rsquo;t even think we can do better than what mommies do naturally.  We hope.</p>\r\n<p>We notice things that we don&rsquo;t pay attention to. &nbsp;I know that doesn't seem to make sense, [First Name], but bear with me. &nbsp;It's the small things.  A dog barking in a lot when I walk by.  Hmm.  I been walking this route for months and no dog.  Now there are two, and as grouchy as Tommy with a hooker who wants extra money to say &quot;<i>Oh, Tommy you are the biggest</i>.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Are these dogs with stay over guests for Christmas?  Ya' Think?</p>\r\n<p>It's that way at christmas, but also all year long. &nbsp;Little things to expect. &nbsp;And when they happen, you notice them and then, <i>just as quickly,</i> <b>not</b> pay attention to it.  Guests will be gone after Christmas, life will return to normal: God&rsquo;s back in his heaven and dog&rsquo;s back in his yard.  And that makes for a good reason to ignore it. &nbsp;Don't sweat the small stuff.</p>\r\n<p>When you live in an area for a while you stop noticing. &nbsp;When you move from HNL, you start noticing. &nbsp;For me, St. John's Jim, Portland is a newborn baby experience of only a year old.

Greedily.</p>\r\n<p>Or you can keep walking and ignore the siren call of a Military Bird Barbecue.  The Big Rock Candy Burger company should have it so good.&nbsp;</p>"

  Message: "<p>&nbsp;By the time you read this, the nation is exhaling the Christmas of 2010.  Right now, though, it is a mad dash to Christmas Eve.</p>\r\n<p>The many merchants of St. John&rsquo;s are frantic in the last moments of seasonal buying.  Established Cafes and Bars are at &lsquo;cruise control,&rsquo;  retailers can be a bit more frantic, and the biggest struggles hit the very most seasonal retailers: Christmas Tree Lots.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">The foot traffic didn&rsquo;t come, even though you spent $500 on a sandwich board and had Joe Schlump walk around town with it.  Come to think of it, where is Joe? &nbsp;Nobody's seen him for two weeks.  D&rsquo;ya think he&rsquo;s not walking around with the sign?  And sitting around waiting for a customer is driving you nuts. &nbsp;Even your dog can tell.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \"><em>&quot;The rain washed away my great chalk candy-cane on the sidewalk.  Oh, crap, where did that customer go?  What were they looking at?  is everything still here?&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>If you are on the customer side of the counter, you have been belted by the national hype machine to inhale the &ldquo;Spirit of the Season,&rdquo; until your credit bursts in the manner of foie gras.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">It is natural that geese adapt to fall by developing large and tasty livers;  It is natural that humans responded by overstuffing the poor goose.  It is natural that we respond to harvest and preparation for winter by wanting to share the bounties of our lives.  It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;Spirit of the Season.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Don't bust a lung.</p>\r\n<p>We have inhaled to the max.  For most it&rsquo;s a yearly exhale.  For those of us who are exploring new chapters, it is more than that.  It may be the exhale to remember.  Savor it.</p>\r\n<p>Know this.  The breath tide has turned, and you exhale the big exhale this special day. &nbsp;National Exhale Day.</p>\r\n<p>And you can savor the moment: We will not need to do anything: National Exhale Week lasts until National Inhale Day: Monday, January 3, 2011.  You will have that time to listen for still small voices.</p>\r\n<p>Listen and savor, [First Name], National Inhale day will also come.</p>"

  Message: "<p>I woke up under the bridge: my Christmas present is new lodgings on Portland&rsquo;s rustic Malibu.  The lodgings are more convenient, more congenial and more spacious.  I give up easy access to Pier Park, but gain a garden.   It offers a  great view, but the whole thing might fall into the water.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I asked Southwick to consult the mycological mat under our feet.  Southwick&rsquo;s nightly alien Myco-probes tell him the topsoil under this part of St. John&rsquo;s is healthy, and wish to thank all the folks who have proper run-off.  The myco-Minds under the soil are happy with the extra water, but dislike being referred to as pond-scum.</p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://StJohnsJim.com/assets/images/bestview.png\"><img alt=\"The Best View in St. John's!\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://StJohnsJim.com/assets/images/bestview.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>Wanting to poke around the new digs, I gaze at the lot.  It&rsquo;s a hillside with jack-in-the-box brambles in the spring.  Work crews are revamping the tree-weed mix in this strip of St. John&rsquo;s to get rid of the berry brambles and save the massive trees.  They are all sticks and trunk now and reveal the best view in town of the St. John&rsquo;s Bridge. &nbsp;Note winter's elegant twigs in the way.</p>\r\n<p>The bridge needs to be seen in the flesh.  It is as majestic as a cathedral, as pro-technology as Gothic Deco can express, the simple lines and motifs are as recognizable at the gut level as the cross.  The experience of sweeping your eyes along the cables is mesmerizing.  It&rsquo;s one of those things you can only experience at the fountainhead.  The underside of the bridge is so beautiful, they call it Cathedral Park. Even the foundations are inspiration for designers. &nbsp;So there.</p>\r\n<p>Enough of the bridge, veiled by brambles, branches, buildings or the lay of the land. &nbsp;Damned burkha. You never can see all of it anyway.  Torquemada, you are one seriously twisted guy to put this beauty just out of reach!</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Well, FU, Torquemada, This IS the best view so if I can&rsquo;t get a better one, I love this one: If you can&rsquo;t be with the one you love, love the one you&rsquo;re with.</p>\r\n<p>I walk up into St. John&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s a vacuum of energy at 7AM on the Sunday Morning after Christmas Day.  From an emotional perspective, the USA is in total exhaustion.  Like the morning after the shock therapy appointment.</p>\r\n<p>I recover by listening to Slurpy Guitar Hawaiian music.  I turn the slurp up to max.  It is deep tissue massage for emotional re-alignment processing.  It&rsquo;s an acquired taste, though.  But I do extole it&rsquo;s properties as an emotional tonic.</p>\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;m walking on a near silent Lombard St in the drizzle remembering palm trees and other such things.  Lena Machado&rsquo;s voice curves along with the guitar. Life is good.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">A friend of mine mentioned that learning to live with the life that you did NOT expect is key.</p>\r\n<p>Slurpy guitar, sweeping arcs, drizzle and palm tree memories.  Supportive friends, new possibilities, and the big rock candy mountain just around the bend, and Life is good, just unexpected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Not what I planned or expected, but I&rsquo;m learning to learn to love it.

  Message: "<p>Thor came to the writer's office shortly after the third lesser ice age.  Initial presenting symptom was depression on a societal level.</p>\n<p>Thor: “My People are weak and unhealthy during the winter.  They fish down by the fjords during the winter and don’t get much exercise”</p>\n<p>Writer: “Well, sir, That’s not my area of psychology, I’m not a social psychologist, but i’ll do what I can:  It’s seasonal depression.  Have people build a big community house in each village to work and feast in, encourage an active village social life. Have them do competitions.  It keeps the sexual urges going, the adrenaline high, you’ll love it”</p>\n<p>Disposition: Client visibly brighter,  Showed interest in hammer throwing.</p>\n<hr/><p>Second Office visit:  Post mastodon extinction trauma.</p>\n<p>Thor: “My people are much more active now.  Great idea, but now I got a different problem: My people are killing each other.  They gather in village houses during the winter and share the heat, work space and cooking, but the arguments and fights from the competitions is killing nearly 20% of the population!”</p>\n<p>Writer: “Well, sir, I suggest you have them compete with animals instead of hand to hand.

Now, my people are killing and maiming and torturing each other. They gather in village houses during the winter and share the heat and cooking.  But the level of nasty has gone through the roof, since we started bear-baiting.  Now it’s more like inhuman mindless rage.”</p>\n<p>Writer: “Well, sir, I suggest you deflect the target of the rage, and have the people start telling tales of how they are going to do all those nasty things to the people down south,  You know in Persia, India, Siberia, Europe, and especially England and Ireland — your people will love it.  Anyway, those countries have riches you can’t even dream of.  Like sanitation.”</p>\n<p>Disposition: Client senses export potential.  Looks forward to hammer throw conventions. And sanitation.</p>\n<hr/><p>Follow up visit, Current times:  Confusion, Attention Deficit, Stress overload.</p>\n<p>Thor: “That was a real good idea, and worked pretty good for a few thousand years, but now my people are getting weak.  We are exporting our best commodity “inhuman mindless rage” to other folks around the world, and now we no longer have a monopoly on “inhuman mindless rage” and we are losing our edge.  In fact some tropical countries are even venturing into “inhuman mindless rage” with incredible success.  I'm toast, we are all toast!  Ahghghhhhhhhh”</p>\n<p>Writer: “Well, sir, I told you that I’m not a social psychologist, but you now have real serious problems with how to deal with reality.  That’s my specialty, so keep talking.  By the way, have you tried Hare Krisna?”</p>\n<p>Disposition: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So if you see a Norse God chanting ‘Hari Hari’ down the street, with a Hammer in one hand and shaved head under his viking hat, you know it’s the end of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>"

  Subject: "Maslow and Celarien Tarot"
  Message: "<p>The Tarot is a set of 72 archetypes.  There are archetypes that describe roles (e.g. High Priestess, Heirophant), situations (e.g. The tower, most of the Minor Arcana), and achievements: (e.g. the star, the sun) -- (the Tarot does not address the change of situations as the I Ching does)</p>\n<p>The Tarot is often associated with fortune telling or predicting the future.  Rather, it simply describes situations or relationships that will always be in your life.  Drawing them in a reading will often help a client find new ways to view a personal situation.</p>\n<p>A recent book addressing men's psychological issues \"King, Warrior, Magician, Lover\" suggests that a man is measured by how competent he is in all of these areas.  The similarity of warrior to \"king of swords\" and lover to \"king of hearts\" seemed obvious, and created a way to relate the Tarot to these same men's issues: becoming a person that is competent as a protector, lover, magician, and provider.  These correspond to the kings of the four suits: Swords for dominion and protection, Cups for human relationships, Wands for creating change and adapting to change, Pentacles for prosperity.</p>\n<p>[SW#K:The King of Swords]: knows how to [SW#1:detect], [SW#2:decide], [SW#3:attack], [SW#4:retreat and recoup], knows [SW#5:domination or loss], [SW#6:protection and flight], [SW#7:the necessary use of subterfuge], [SW#8:take hostages], [SW#9:knows the lonliness of leadership and the power of fear], [SW#10:victory and defeat].</p>\n<p>The King of Wands: knows how to adapt and create events, detect, decide, promote, harness, debate, prevail, multitask, maintain, and succomb.</p>\n<p>The King of Hearts: knows self, relationships, transient pleasures, ennui, regret, memories, fantasies, discernment, lasting pleasures, family harmony.</p>\n<p>[KP:The King of Pentacles]: knows opportunity, partnerships, life as worker, money management, poverty, investment, ability to nurture for future harvest, craft, personal economic security, family economic security.</p>\n<p>The tarot implies that the \"Emperor\" is competent in all the four suits: the Emperor is a king of all suits.  That's the essence of the tarot's message for men: you must achieve in all four domains to be the emperor of your domain.</p>\n<p>Another view of the major and minor arcana fits well with Maslow's heirarchy of needs, and separates into details the aspects of his needs.</p>\n<div class=\"captionImage left\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Maslow's needs (from Wikipedia)</p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><img class=\"leftAlone\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg\" width=\"424\" height=\"376\"/></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Tarot of Celarien based needs</p>\n</div>\n<p><img class=\"leftAlone\" src=\"assets/_resampled/resizedimage536402-Celarien-Heirarchy.001.gif\" width=\"536\" height=\"402\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"color: #000000;

You thought I was just talking through my tookus, but I found out the most fabulous bit of new-age, secular WGAF, entrepreneurial, high-tech low-life that you can imagine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did that catch your attention?  I hope it did, because when I found this happening on the very streets that I imagine in St. John’s, I did a double take that was 7.8 on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Finlayson_(actor)\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Finlayson</a> scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Date: December 28, 2010 - first sighting: Street hooker on Wheelchair mobility device.  Traveling on Lombard Ave in an easterly direction.  Talking on cell phone -- something about \"roller johns\" or \"john derby\"</p>\n<p>December 31, 2010 - Another street hooker on identical wheelchair mobility device.  Traveling on Ivanhoe St to St. John’s Bridge.  Dropped cell  phone.  I picked it up,  it was still connected.  Hooker came back and said “I’m talking to my dispatcher.  He wants me to join up with the St. John’s Musk Maidens.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I went away confused.  Musk maidens?  Dispatcher?  Join? And what’s with the electric wheel chair?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I ask Sandy and Southwick, my experts in street life, and find that the “Hookers on Wheels” is a pilot program of PCDS -- <em>Psycho-Commies for the Destruction of Society.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>January 2, 2011 — Wheels click slowly.  And Bammo!  it hits.  The Psycho-Commies have organized hookers into a call and dispatch system that is identical to any pizza delivery service.  With a mobility device for the more mature hooker, the sex trade may be more efficient because of our medical support system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>America: Entrepreneurial opportunity exists everywhere.  Even if it is absolutely illegal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soon there may be tax savings for other hybrid or electric personal mobility devices: the Segway for example.  If so, the younger, more sporty hooker will be able to use the same “hookers on wheels” service.  Although younger hookers will hesitate to align with the Psycho-Commies, but may link with ENEH -- <em>the Eco-Nazis for the Elimination of Humanity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank heavens for the tax incentives of \"<a title=\"Beware what trickles down\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRTi5XjYVeWw\">golden showers economics</a>\" as proposed by our economic magicians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>January 4, 2011 — \"Roller Johns,\" “Musk Maidens:”  those phrases have been going through my head for days.  What the??  It sounds like some ’50s Drive in Movie. And then -- bang! It hit’s me.  Not drive in <em>movies</em> from the ‘50s, but <strong><em>Roller Derby</em></strong> from the ’50s.  Crazy teams, following crazy rules with that annoying ’skee-skee-skeee’ sound of metal wheels on hardwood.  Slamming, tripping, pile-ups.  Lots of thighs.  And on the most humble of transportation -- roller skates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just like a wet tee-shirt contest and rush-hour mixed with food stamp vouchers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Conclusion</em> -- Point one: The hookers are being dispatched on wheelchairs. Point two: They are forming teams to scoop Johns  off the sidewalks and utilize the skate-board parks for team play.</p>\n<p>You may imagine the commercial potential of drugged-out hookers on hi-tech WI-FI controlled wheel chairs rolling around a figure 8 track.  Scooping and fleecing johns in 20 minute sweeps.  Kama Sutra points optional.</p>\n<p>Is the America that brings you \"<a title=\"To cover up the claw marks? Meow!\" href=\"http://www.eonline.com/on/shows/bridalplasty/index.html\">BridalPlasty</a>\" far away from this ultimate reality show?  <em><strong>Hooker Derby</strong></em> has plenty of willing johns and hookers, an entrepreneurial spirit worthy of Al Capone, a technical vision equal to Windows Vista, and a police presence that has a reach equal to Starbucks!</p>\n<p>What can St John's lose?</p>"

  Message: "<p>[author:This e-mail is for my amigos and amigas at the NeuroBiological Learning Society.  The papers in the link might make for an an interesting starting point for a night of inquiry.</p>\n<p>A recent web-link that I saw was a bit on the way we <a href=\"http://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/worg/publications.html\" target=\"_blank\">smell</a>.  From the No Bullshit Weizmann Institute in Israel.  Really, like how the neural impulses interact, where they go, what kind of effect on our consciousness.  Yeah.  Real science.  I know -- boring.  ZZZZzzzz --- snork -- zzzzz.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Until I saw this title: \"<em>Sniffing enables communication and environmental control for the severely disabled</em>\" -- You have no idea what JOY I felt as the Muse sat up from her coffin and said:] </p>\n<p>Of course you have heard of the “iron” chef — able to take on all comers with a paring knife in one hand and in the other, one bizarre and inedible ingredient.  Like crab gonads.  What ever you think of as “comfort food,” be assured that the metallized chef will not be cooking that tonight, thank you.</p>\n<p>[comment:Soto:I'm bulimic -- There is NO comfort food, only comfort vomiting.][comment:Voce:No Way!  Me too!]</p>\n<p>So, you may not have heard of Samuel Doveout — magna cum laude graduate of the Boca du Linguica School of Gastronomical Broadcasting.  His meteoric career, rising from poverty to Chief chef at the La Boca Cuisinaire was paralleled by his TV presentations where he would press huge buttons behind him on the stage so that pre-programmed aromas would be wafted to viewers of his “aroma channel”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[comment:Voce: Didn't he do something with bulls loose on the set?][comment:Soto: Having a charging bull behind you is a real boost to the appetite.  It's called the Pamplona Picnic.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His food was so popular, that to keep the crowds away, they renamed his establishment to “Sam ’n Ella.”</p>\n<p>The resulting riot of customers who reasoned: “With a name like ‘Sam ’n Ella,’ you know it’s got to be good” left Samuel in critical condition.  Burns on over 75% of his body, and loss of all major sense organs, along with a broken neck  and massive injuries resulted in a recovery that took three years, followed by another five to regain his niche along side the cooking greats: (Sweet ) “Bam” Marjoram, Curry Favre, The Incredible Garlique, and Generic Fatguy from Southern Climates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[comment:Soto:I <strong>LOVE</strong> Generic Fatguy!][comment:Voce:The one from Hawaii or the one from Lousiana?]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a testament to human endurance and adaptability, Sam has regained his empire of cuisine using his only functioning sense organs: smell and taste.  Yes, he is a quadraplegic, lost his voice, sight, hearing and feeling over 90% of his body.  All that remains is his ability to detect the slightest gradations in flavor, texture and aroma.  His communication with the outside world is limited to sniffs, jaw and tongue movement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[comment:Soto: Did you know that because rats sniff faster than humans, we only get 1/6 of the smell-o-vision that they do?][comment:Voce:But a great chef only sniffs the right sniffs.  Sniff smarter, not harder.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Armed only with aroma, taste, and a great dentist, biometric high-technicians of Science (Thanks, Bill Nye)  have created a way to communicate with this unique nose. And the result?</p>\n<p>Doveout has been knighted and given the coveted NokiaExxon Mobility Chair at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-American_(Campbell's)\" target=\"_blank\">FrancoAmerican </a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Boiardi\" target=\"_blank\">Boy-ar-Dee</a> institute.</p>\n<p>He has won 8 out of 10 “Brazen Imitation” Chef awards from a selection of his peers.  He gives sniff lectures on the Fox Network and 700 club.  He has a seasoned pass as a guest slot on TV shows from Jon Stewart to Billy Graham to The Simpsons and the Baron Von Munchausen hour.</p>\n<p>He recently published the essential “Love of Lard” and the “Offerings of Offal” — both lard and offal are now main courses in 90% of american homes. He is quoted by Prime Ministers, Sub-prime Ministers, Governers, Mayors and Presidents.</p>\n<p>In a manner similar to “The Who’s” rock opera: “Tommy,” a new theraputic technique has arisen whereby people are temporarily given symptoms exactly like Samuel’s.   The treatment costs $200,000 per week and has been booked for five years into the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only in America.  Or whatever follows... </p>\n</blockquote>"

I need Wisdom, Inspiration, Continuity, Keen Emotions, Dialog, Compassion.  I need my muse, queen of the seven chakras and nine tantras: W.I.C.K.E.D. Compassion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You see, Tommy convinced me that I had so many projects that I needed to get a replacement for the old-school goddess muse and get a model that pumps out greeting cards, facebook wall comments, ad copy for rent-a-used-fencepost business (that last is a trendy business on the Malibu of St. John’s. — There is a ready made library of twigs, sticks and branches in Baltimore Wood).  It just seemed to make business sense. Tommy said he had connections with an overseas supplier.[comment:Soto: Lets start a community library of tools from old construction projects.  People can check out drills, saws and stuff!]</p>\n<p>[comment:Voce:So how is that different than what we got <a style=\"font-family: Verdana, Lucida, Arial, sans-serif; text-decoration: none; color: #3e91c4;\" href=\"http://www.northportlandtoollibrary.org/\">already</a>?]</p>\n<p>The MuseCycle 900 was a mess to put together, and the parts and packing are scattered around my mind.  I got most of the steps completed and finally got around to reading the instructions.  It said: “<em>Attention: requires operation by authentic classic goddess muse</em>.”</p>\n<p>Tommy had scammed me!  Can you believe it?  Scammed by my own comic creation?  I know it’s impossible, but there is simply no other explanation.  When the muse don’t sing, ALL explanations work.  So believe me.</p>\n<p>I rushed over to Tommy, OR, and knocked.  Tommy was hiding in the back.  He does that sometimes, in case it’s a bible salesman or old girl friend.  I thought: \"Tommy, you simpleton, you have no idea who you are dealing with, I’m the fucking AUTHOR!\"</p>\n<p>So I unleashed my signature ninja move, the hallowed [roar:<em>Roar of the Lion]</em>: “Southwick, open the door.  Now.  Where’s Tommy!  What’s he done to my muse!  Where is Wickie?”</p>\n<p>Southwick opened the door, and I went out back where Tommy was painting racing stripes on a caterpillar tractor.</p>\n<p>Me: “OK, Tommy, bust loose with the truth, buddy.  I’m the author. So help me, I’ll start writing you in the style of Faulkner!  You will only be a hollow object of pity. The scum of mythology.”</p>\n<p>Tommy replied: “Oh, no, not that...  OK, well you and I thought it would be a good idea to juice up the voltage on the writing thing, and you got all that tree-hugger organic muse fodder and everything.”</p>\n<p>Me: “Muse Fodder!  You cant talk about <em>Wicked Compassion</em> that way!  A muse is a delicate and sophisticated deity of perfection — able to distill reality into wisdom”</p>\n<p>Tommy replied: “Don’t let no muse fool you: They all want one thing.  Anyway, I got her here.  She’s no use to me, she doesn’t write porn.”</p>\n<p>Me: “Tommy, if she is going to write porn, she ain’t gonna do it for you, buddy.  No more mucking with my muse again”</p>\n<p>--“Not so fast, bub,  I’ll make Tommy a porn star if I want to.  Look at him there, he’s balancing a beer on his pects, no, let’s make it an outboard motor.  Yup, a much funnier image than reality.”</p>\n<p>Me -  “Oh, Wickie, where you been, I’m missing you so much…”[comment:Voce:Did he just call her 'Wickie'?!][comment:Soto:Just imagine what <em>she</em> calls him!]</p>\n<p>Wickie - “Well, you could stop chasing me!  I’ll come out when I feel safe and want to have a fun time.  And more Talking Heads, and Van Morrison, too.”</p>\n<p>Me - “I’ve got a MuseCycle 900!”</p>\n<p>Wickie - “That cheap ass thing, I’ll bet Tommy got it from one of those Chinese Hi-tech sites where he gets his \"prescriptions\".  Watch out for that stuff!</p>\n<p>   --   If you are a real author, you’ll get me the MuseCycle 902.  It’s got the GB Shaw option. Or would you like Two Weeks of False Starts?”</p>"

She puts the toy in my hands.  I look at it:  It&rsquo;s a short plastic tube has a screen on one end and a rotating magnifying glass on the other.</p>\r\n<p>Lightning tells me it is a bug-catcher-watcher-holder.  Sky tells me that a fan sucks the bugs in and then you can pivot the magnifying glass into the closed position to inspect the cooties.  I figure it out in microseconds: &ldquo;You mean you collect bugs to inspect?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Lightning says: &ldquo;I told you that already: it&rsquo;s a bug-catcher-watcher-holder&rdquo; and then she runs down the path to the bug havens just below our perch on the bluff.  Her younger brother, Cloud,  looking serious, follows lightning down the path.</p>\r\n<p>I share a few minutes with Earth and Sky.  Parental Olympic Games are discussed and evaluated:  These practical, day-to-day Olympics truly produce gods, and the titans of Earth and Sky strive for gold.</p>\r\n<p>Lightning runs back up the path with a look of delight in her eyes: &ldquo;Look at what I have found!&rdquo;  As Cloud catches up, Lightning has run up to mom and hastily puts her gadget together.

Cloud darkens and starts to shower.  Lightning looks like she has seen the crack of doom.</p>\r\n<p>Sky reaches across the table and touches Earth on her wrist and nods in compassion.  Earth smiles back, brushes her face, picks up Cloud and kisses him gently, and says: &ldquo;How Fun! Go get some more, but let&rsquo;s not spray bugs on people, OK?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Lightning says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mommie, Come on Cloud, let&rsquo;s find some more!&rdquo; &nbsp;Cloud brightens and shows his silver lining as he follows.</p>"

  Message: "<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">[First Name], I have been under tremendous psychic pressure. &nbsp;But now, since I know for sure, that I'm not Oprah's sister, the Gates of Literary Creation have opened. &nbsp; How long? &nbsp;Who knows. &nbsp;Literary obsessions come and go like boy bands. &nbsp;Here is Joe:</p>\r\n<p>Joe, you know. Judge Joe on TV.  One of the most plugged in shows ever.  It has reduced the pressure on our legal system, and at the same time made beer sales go through the roof.</p>\r\n<p>Joe became famous while tending bar at the Puking Mule Tavern. &nbsp;Yes, [First Name], you and I may have puked our mules together at this very tavern in St. John's.</p>\r\n<p>As you might know, there are lots of disputes among our almost-working class here in St. John&rsquo;s, (which may be patient #1 in the global epidemic of&nbsp;almost-working.) &nbsp;Most of these disputes are petty, and Joe had a talent for talking his patrons into flipping coins to resolve disputes.</p>\r\n<p>Joe soon found his customers would just as soon resolve money disputes by watching a live game as by flipping a dime.   With an agreeable team matchup and point spread, the plaintiff and defendant&rsquo;s case would be determined by the game&rsquo;s outcome.</p>\r\n<p>Joe occasionally made some enemies, but mostly his patrons felt more comfortable with an honest game than a lawyer.  And with the beer challenge, most cases didn&rsquo;t last past half-time.  After a while, Joe figure out how to  make money as a dispute resolution service.  He was able to run more than one dispute at a time.</p>\r\n<p>Joe: &ldquo;Plaintiff, Defendent: you&rsquo;ve both been bonded, your case has been OK&rsquo;ed by the house and all you both parties concerned know the rules. Now you&rsquo;se guys will be OK with the Pittsburg Steamers against the Washington DoucheBags on a twelve point spread.  Defendant: Which side do you want?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Defendant: Give me the steamers.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Joe: &quot;That OK with you?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff: &quot;Works for me.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Joe: &quot;One of you guys takes a drink anytime in the game and you lose your case.  Shake hands.  Here&rsquo;s your first beer. I&rsquo;ll keep it fresh.  Drink up and lose.&quot; &nbsp;Joe chuckles kindly: &quot;So lose already so you can buy my beer.&rdquo; &nbsp;You almost feel sorry for Joe.</p>\r\n<p>During a playoff season, Joe&rsquo;s ability to have the crowd chant: &ldquo;Drink, Drink, Drink&rdquo; after each spectacular play, caused most disputes to get over quickly, and made his sales skyrocket.</p>\r\n<p>Joe started small, with a $250 dollar small-claims limit, but the popularity of the scheme resulted in more and more cases, bigger cases. &nbsp;He even went online and created a network of affiliated bars using his scheme.</p>\r\n<p>Congressional committees, Gaming authorities and Tea-party candidates flooded the network news. &nbsp;It all resulted in a probe by the Justice Department, Court Clerks, County Clerks and Clerics in general. &nbsp; After the Supreme Court was given an &quot;Supossitorius Inna YouEndo&quot; by the Cable Network Industry, Joe was granted an endorsement as Judge in the Experimental Court of Sports Recognition.   He became the first Doctor of Laws in the field.</p>\r\n<p>The rest is history.  There is even talk of having Criminal cases tried by Joe.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Trial by gladiator.  It happened once upon a time, so I&rsquo;m told.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Susanna's Song"
  Message: "<p>Looking out over the prairie, Susanna fingered her white dress nervously. The thunder storm was quickly getting too close: distant flashes and long kettledrum rolls had changed to sharp cracks.   She would get her best dress soaked and her hair drenched up by the time she got to the Kenton place.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">The family had left for the meeting over at the Kenton place about an hour earlier, but Susanna had wanted to take the extra time to look especially good when she saw Kenny Kenton.  Susanna&rsquo;s mom looked at her and said: &ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it.  Come along.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Susanna let that phrase bounce in her head: &ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo;   Then she thought: &ldquo;Well, OK, think of something to say about it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Susanna said: &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t get back till late, and the chores that we miss now will just be extra work for you when you get back.  You can go ahead, I&rsquo;ll do the chores on time, and get myself ready.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Susanna&rsquo;s dad said &ldquo;Smart thinkin&rsquo;, Susanna. &nbsp;Make sure you give the medicine to Lucky when the vet said. &mdash;  Ma, you done right good with this one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So, an hour and a half later, facing the oncoming thunderstorm, Susanna was thinking: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get soaked.  I&rsquo;ll look terrible&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Not if I have anything to say about it&quot; her mom's voice echoing in her head. At that she struck out in a trot toward the Indian rocks only a couple of miles away. When she got there, she had thistles all over her socks and dress. But the rocks did offer up a dry space for Susanna to sit out the storm.</p>\r\n<p>Susanna waited. The storm was a real soaker with drops as big as the end of your thumb but she was dry and safe, smelling the air as it changed from dust to clean and then to lightning sweet.</p>\r\n<p>She started picking the thistles out and thought. &ldquo;Even if I get all these out, I still have to join the road a bit farther on to cross the bridge.  That means through more stickyberries to get to the gathering at the Kenton place. I'll get there and look a sight.  Darn Thistles&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The storm passed and moved on as storms do, Susanna struck out for the road muttering to herself about how much fun she would miss out on.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the ugly duckling for sure,&rdquo; she said as she looked over to the stream.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it. &nbsp;-- I know where there is a dinghy tied up there, and I would shave 20 minutes off my time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Susanna struck out for the stream and got there only to find the stream swollen from the storm.  The dinghy was tied to a small tree by the bank, but the oarlocks were gone.  Susanna plopped down and surveyed the sad situation.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t paddle through this current with no oarlocks.  I&rsquo;m sunk.&rdquo;  She looked at her white dress.  &ldquo;I could take my dress off, and put it in the boat along with the present I made for Kenny and swim across, but I can&rsquo;t tow a dinghy thru this current.  I&rsquo;ll have to go the long way around to get to the bridge.  I&rsquo;ll get there late and I&rsquo;ll look a fright.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As she looked at the little boat, she noticed the stream receding a bit.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo;  She got up and looked up and down the stream bank.  She found a fallen tree branch, waited until the stream slowed, and used the branch to pole the dinghy across.  Tying the dinghy on the other side, she made it over the hill by the Kenton&rsquo;s place just to see Jenny coming down the walkway with a bright yellow dress.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, rats, Jenny&rsquo;s dress looks so much nicer than mine.  What a horrid time I&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Then Susanna remembered the fields of wildflowers she had just passed.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo;  She ran back to the bright flowers, and taking the ribbon off of the present, she made a plait of flowers, just like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/images?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=en&amp;biw=1031&amp;bih=616&amp;tbs=isch%3A1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=haku+lei&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=\">haku leis</a> she had seen in a magazine&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Walking down the hill by the Kenton place, Susanna&rsquo;s hair and dress blew softly in the breeze.  Jenny looked out the window.  Their eyes met: Jenny thought &ldquo;Back off, girl, Kenny is mine!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Susanna gazed back, smiled, and sang to herself, &ldquo;Not if I have anything to say about it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">The only thing we might know for sure, is that Kenny will likely have little to say about it.</p>"

  Message: "<p>[First Name], you may remember from a [dentalki:story last December] that I was able to decode the WikiLeaks atom bomb, poison pill, stick a pin-in-your-eye-hope-to-die ultra secret file.  I had the key!  (I’m sure that just saying that will prompt a visit to my door by some three letter agency.)</p>\n<p>You see, [First Name], as I was returning from a dental appointment, the effects of the anesthetic wearing off at exactly the right time made it possible for me to grab the key from the seemingly random digits on the broken transit displays.  I’ve been reading machine language code dumps since 1966.  It was a piece of cake.</p>\n<p>I found out what was in the file that assures Mr. Assange that he can avoid government prosecution.  No government on earth would touch him.  But I found something even more important!</p>\n<p>In the file is an MP3 file of “Happy Birthday.”  Now every performer knows that you don’t screw with “Happy Birthday.”  It’s copyrighted, and the Hills Sisters, even though they are 150 years old, have a well trained set of lawyers that go after any performance.  Poison pill file or not.  Even governments fear the Hill Sisters.  They speak from the grave.   And Lawyers listen.</p>\n<p>Even now, the lawyers are building their case, and applying a fixed formula for every time Mr. Assange’s file had been accessed, factor in the number of international boundaries that have been crossed per each access, etc, etc.  You get the picture.</p>\n<p>In the end, Mr. Assange will be less than penniless, as no currency is beyond the grasp of a slick legal maneuver, and his buying power will be on the order of a clam near Pismo Beach.</p>\n<p>The only bright light will be an offer of asylum by the new nation of Coldadonia: A Libertarian experiment in privatized government proposed and supplied by the Blackwater Security Corporation.  They will extend life-time citizenship and freedom from extradition to any immigrant.</p>\n<p>The nation of Coldadonia is the size of Manhattan and is only a few miles from Little America, the closest neighbor at the South Pole. The capitol city of Nuevo Guantanamo exports premium ice for the war against global warming, postage stamps, and 10,000 year old penguin guano used by organic farmers everywhere.</p>\n<p>Many cash-strapped governments are encourageing their inmates to accept offers of asylum to Coldadonia.</p>\n<p>I’m sure he’ll jump at the offer.  They offer free wi-fi.  And if we lose the war on global warming, they’ll likely have palm trees down there soon.</p>"

  Subject: "Southwick in the Slammer??!!!"
  Message: "<p>I saw Southwick getting off the 75 early this morning.  Odd, I had not seen Southwick for a while.  He had not showered in several days and had a tired, but agitated look.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;Hey, Southwick, buddy, wassup?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: &quot;Oh, no.  You.  What do you want?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;Southwick?  Is that you?  I&rsquo;ve never heard you talk like that.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>He: &quot;They kicked me out at 3AM!  I had to wait forever for the first bus.  And cold!?! &nbsp;I froze my nuts off.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;Who did?  Where were you??  Lemme buy you grits and eggs at the James John Cafe.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>He blubbered a thank you and kind of fell in a heap.  I dragged him across the street to the cafe&rsquo;s secret location where he told me the most curious story.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick got implicated in a toxic waste disposal racket.  It seems that some styrofoam was put into the &ldquo;glass only&rdquo; recycle bin at the house at 3 Gunas Lp.  The red light in the recycle truck went wild and since 3 Gunas Lp is under &ldquo;special protection&rdquo;  the cops were forced to defer to their arch rival in police protection: the dreaded harbor police.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick went outside thinking nothing was out of the ordinary (except for the unicorns playing beneath the cedars of Pier Park.) &ldquo;Damned false Spring, those Unicorns will catch their death..&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">&mdash; and then *Pow*, ***Bang***, ! ! ! Batman ! ! ! --- &nbsp; Face down on the concrete mattress.  A huge boot was put on his neck.  Then a long silence.  &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong with this thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>For the next ten minutes, the cops had Southwick read the taser&rsquo;s instruction manual to them.  He made sure they understood all the settings, menu displays. &nbsp;Finally he made sure they filled in the warrantee card.  That kind of thing.  The patrolmen thanked him and asked him to get face down on the sidewalk again.  Again the boot on the neck.  &ldquo;Click, Click, ZeeEeeEeePOP&rdquo;: The feeling of a sewing machine in the neurons.&mdash; It&rsquo;s like that with government workers.  Gotta follow procedure, you know.</p>\r\n<p>He woke up inside the harbor detention center, where he was grilled endlessly about his involvement in Tommy&rsquo;s toxic waste laundering scheme.  Southwick was shown line ups of smelly tar, sludge and assorted gooey stuff until the wee hours of the night:  &ldquo;Do you recognize any of these?  Have you seen any of these on the property at 3 Gunas Lp or anywhere in the sovereign county of Tommy,OR?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick answered as honestly as he could.  &ldquo;I rent a room from Tommy. &nbsp;He has lots of stuff. &nbsp;If I could remember one sludge from the next do you think I would be in St. John&rsquo;s?  I&rsquo;d be the king of sludge city: it&rsquo;s a precious skill only highly paid members of the chemical cognoscenti can handle.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick continued:&nbsp;&quot;I can&rsquo;t even remember the name or face of the last cop that tased me.  I haven&rsquo;t been so confused since Tommy put an electric eel in my hat: I can&rsquo;t remember nothing.  Except the serial number of that taser:  It&rsquo;s SN X437723.  And a model number 22VXX.  And, Oh, yes: According to the manual, and the PV=NRT formula for the reaction of Boyle&rsquo;s law and 80% Garbage In, Garbage out formula, you have overloaded that sucker and you have voided your warrantee protection.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>At this the officers glanced at each other nervously, backing slowly away until they bumped into the walls of the room.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Remember Ralph?  He got slammed with a warrantee violation three weeks before his retirement&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;OMG.  Poor bastard, not even the union could help.&rdquo;  None of them wanted to be involved in unlawful warrantee violation.</p>\r\n<p>They dumped Southwick into a holding cell to figure out what to do. &nbsp;He was put in with Danny the Drooler and WaHoo the Mahu, who kept dancing and shouting &ldquo;I got the Boogie-wumps.&rdquo;  Well, only WaHoo did the dancing and singing.  Danny the Drooler really had only one skill.  After a while, Southwick was told that they had no further questions: he was free to go, but if he ever met any sludge, toxic or not, he would not be treated so well. &nbsp;Next time...</p>\r\n<p>He was released on his own forgetfulness and challenged to remember any of the preceding except his own humiliation. &nbsp;He complied easily.</p>\r\n<p>I felt I had to rescue Southwick from this negative spiral of self hate:</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I said: &quot;Southwick, those &quot;mouthpiece&quot; skills that Tommy has taught you are awesome. &nbsp;You have convinced the cops that you are the the son of the mouth.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>[First Name], need I remind you that Tommy is Professor of Ethics at Waterfront U. &nbsp;From now on, Southwick is under &ldquo;special protection.&rdquo; &nbsp; St. John&rsquo;s now has another famous criminal: &quot;Sludge&quot; Southwick.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"

  Message: "<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">All the way the paper bag was on my knee.  &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>\r\n<p>I met Leo and Station early last month.  I have been given the OK by both of them to tell their story here.  It involves a computer chip I found in my bar of soap.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Georgia's always on my mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mind.  &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>\r\n<p>Leo is an international expert in cyber security, and Station is his live-in estranged gay housekeeper.  Station is from the Philippines and his name means &ldquo;stations of the cross&rdquo; or something like that, but in English his name sounded too much like &ldquo;crustaceon.&rdquo;  He maintains the look of the whole neighborhood: it explains all the papasan chairs in the trees.  I&rsquo;m not sure about the estranged part, but they never talk to each other.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, Station had been giving me tips on organic gardening:  1/3 perlite, 1/3 moxibustion, 1/3 chicken adobo &mdash; That kind of stuff.  By the time he gets to the moxibustion, my eyes glaze over and I try to change the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Me:  &ldquo;Did I tell you I found a computer chip in my soap this morning?  It&rsquo;s warm enough today for the pipes to unfreeze, so I took a shower, and in the last sliver of the bar, I found this tiny circuit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Station: &ldquo;You should get another brand of soap.  Nicer to your skin than&nbsp;computer chips.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;It's free. &nbsp;I won a contest on the internet a couple of years ago: I get a lifetime supply of Georgia Soap.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>By the time I said internet, Station&rsquo;s eyes glazed over and he kind of wandered down the bluff and continued stringing english ivy in the tree-tops.</p>\r\n<p>As I walked back to my digs, Leo came running out of their house toward me: &ldquo;I hear you use Georgia soap.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me:  &ldquo;WTF?  Yeah, How&rsquo;d you know?  I found a chip in it this morning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Honey, disconnect the phone.  &mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>\r\n<p>Leo is kind of a celebrity in St. John&rsquo;s:  He always has a couple of bombshell ladies on his arm in public, but he never bring any of them back to his place.  He speaks with a bit of a brogue, and is slightly pompous and hardly ever answers a question.  He leaves for a few days every so often.  Station will just sit outside the front door and wait till Leo gets back.</p>\r\n<p>Leo: &ldquo;But is the soap any good?   Or is it a pube magnet?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soap.  Georgia Soap.  Soap with a goddamn computer chip in it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo:  &ldquo;Of course.  Where you been?  Oh,  you didn&rsquo;t read the whole Puritan Act, did you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Been away so long I hardly knew the place..gee, it's good to be back home&nbsp;&mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Uh, no, uh, I was going to, but I never found time.  Or needed to go to sleep that badly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo: &ldquo;Georgia bought out the entire technology from Bogostan when the Soviet Union broke up.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Verdana; margin-left: 40px; \">you don't know how lucky you are boys&nbsp;&mdash; Lennon &amp; McCartney</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Soviet Union?  Technology?  They would use a Sledge Hammer to smash an atom.  And there in no place called Bogostan. And what's that got to do with the U. S. Puritan Act?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo: &ldquo;Forget the Soviet Union, I&rsquo;m talking Bogostan.   The Bogostani&rsquo;s had electronic surveillance tricks that we are still trying to figure out.  It&rsquo;s a country that is so secretive, it erased it self completely from all historical record in 1992.  It&rsquo;s mind boggling how they did that, but Georgia owns the technology now.  That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t remember.  Even now, we are still not sure if Bogostan really exists.  That&rsquo;s how good their technology is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;What <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=smart+dust&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">technology</a>?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo: &ldquo;The GPS body scanner chips.  In the soap, dummy.  Don&rsquo;t you read the on-line user&rsquo;s manual for your soap?  You had 30 days from first shower, you know.  It&rsquo;s referenced in the U.S. Puritan Act under Appendix 23.A.21&mdash; &ldquo;mostly fair use.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;GPS?  What the hell for?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo: &ldquo;GPS, you know - Georgia Personal Surveillance -- The soap maps out every square inch of your body as you shower.  Tussaud&rsquo;s had secretly leased the technology from Bogostan for their Wax Museum:  That&rsquo;s why their wax statues are so realistic.  Nowadays, the scans are used to generate advertisements tailored to your body contours.  I bet you don&rsquo;t get any SPAM about breast enlargement, do you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;No, I get lots of ads for Peni&hellip;&rdquo;  My voice trailed off as the truth hit me.  They know.  Everything.  Every mole and freckle.  And it&rsquo;s in the soap!</p>\r\n<p>Leo walked off down the bluff toward Station.  He stopped halfway, awkwardly looked around like a cat trying to pretend he had other business and then ran back toward his car and left.</p>\r\n<p>Station stood up, walked to the front door of their house and sat down outside. &nbsp;That was over a week ago, and he has been sitting, silently looking up the roadway ever since.  Station hasn&rsquo;t done any work on the neighbor hood.  The english ivy is still only half-way up the trees.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I didn&rsquo;t get to bed last night, and now&nbsp;Georgia's always on my mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mind.</p>"

  Subject: "The Daough Sister's Sustainable Cat Lips"
  Message: "<p>[First Name],  I have noticed some neighborhood cats with red or purple lips.  I thought you might want to know more.</p>\r\n<p>Let me introduce you to another interesting couple nearby.  Winnie and her sister Pathy.  They have been living together since the 80&rsquo;s &mdash; they both got divorced at nearly the same time and decided to pool their resources.  Pathy moved to St. John&rsquo;s from Florida: She was one of the original Girls Gone Bananas in 1957 and had entertained her way into the personal lives of some very influential politicians there.  She finally married into the power circle, but when her marriage went on the rocks, she was left with a choice: Grab what little you can and leave quietly or stay and get snuffed.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie, on the other hand, had stayed behind in Portland and lived in her parent&rsquo;s house.  She had done better in her divorce settlement, and promptly retired keeping all her assets in the name of her parent&rsquo;s estate.  Winnie and Pathy have become leaders in sustainable living for the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie is likely the best &ldquo;found material&rdquo; artisan in Oregon: she can turn a toilet float into a kid&rsquo;s party balloon.  And Pathy has a green thumb that can make a horseshoe grow roots.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m talking with Pathy and Winnie in their house:  Pathy is repotting seedlings on a table in the middle of her harum of cats.  I counted seven, but Pathy said &ldquo;There are lots of them but many of them are dead now, and some come and go for days or weeks at a time.  There was Elvis, he was the first, and he jumped into my car when he was running away from a Florida &lsquo;gator.  I had him for twelve years until...&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Winnie broke in and asked me if I wanted a glass of milk or a Blood Orange cookie:  She had the manner of a high-octane granny, full of crafts and Old School home economics, like how to make lipstick for hens out of cow placenta.  Winnie said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle substance!  There are over 80 ways to use the goodness of placenta in a sustainable fashion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I thought better than to ask how to prepare any of those 80 ways.  I had to sit through about three of them anyway.  Don&rsquo;t ask, but I&rsquo;ll likely never eat any of Winnie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blood Orange&rdquo; cookies.</p>\r\n<p>I had trouble following all that Pathy and Winnie had to say because they both were watching TV.  Different channels.  At the same time.  And talking to me, to their TV sets, and to each other at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>Pathy tunes into a daytime talk show with a guy who specializes in interviewing sociopaths, arranging family interventions with sociopaths, and generally recognizing it as the natural behavior that it is: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s remove the stigma of Sociopathy&rdquo; &mdash; That day he is interviewing Adaman Eaves, the ousted finance minister of the National Bank of Cash.  &ldquo;Ever since I read <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Snakes-Suits-When-Psychopaths-Work/dp/0060837721\">Snakes in Suits</a> I realized I wasn&rsquo;t ALONE!  That there were people with the same condition, and I no longer felt the victim of my &ldquo;terrible malady&rdquo; &mdash; I broke down and cried when I realized I was a sociopath and I could be proud of it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>All during this, Pathy was saying things to the TV like &ldquo;My Sam did that too.&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK.  Lots of them feel they are just doing their duty, too.&rdquo;  Or even: &ldquo;Keep on trying!&rdquo;  Pathy&rsquo;s cats pawed the screen every so often.</p>\r\n<p>On the other TV, just as loud, was Boujie P. a local video Crock Jock who goes out on the street to show the most fabulous ways to decorate and brighten up using common Shopping Mall ingredients.  He is giving a street person a make over with a bedazzler.  The in-studio audience oohs and ahs as he shows how to use a little spray on snow to turn blackberry vines into family heirlooms.  Finally, he turns to the camera, and says: &ldquo;Next week, we will explore exiting neon light piercings for that Moose Head on the mantle.  Bye bye, Portland&rsquo;s Bourgeoisie, I&rsquo;m Boujie P, my glitz challenged friends: OK, now everyone - Hold your breath!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>All during this, Winnie was moving around the house and jumping up and down and shouting things to her TV like:  &ldquo;Boojie! You&rsquo;ve got a gift for glitter!&rdquo; &ldquo;I can do that for half the price!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I sent him that idea, he loved it!&rdquo; &mdash; Winnie showed me the autographed photo Boojie sent her.</p>\r\n<p>I think it explains the sustainable supply of red and purple lipstick for our neighborhood cats.  Just thank the Daough Sisters.</p>"

  Message: "<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\nWell, [First Name], they are more like helmets, and are really painted on, and she likely should have used the name <em>Peck-and-Panic</em>&hellip;  But I digress.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie Daough, you may remember is a whiz-a-holic for creating organic niche products out of found materials.  She patented the twig straightener and the blackberry-thorn necklace stringing machine.  Blackberry thorn necklaces were a fad in Portland for 2 weeks in 1986, but Winnie has perfected her machine since then.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie is totally practical when it comes to her life&rsquo;s essentials - in this case, exotic hens.  These are her special passion.  My eyes glaze over when she mentions the &ldquo;radiated doohicky&rdquo; or the &ldquo;passion pistol, bambino cross.&rdquo;  I infer that these are different breeds or chicken neuroses or such.</p>\r\n<p>She shoots me a look that clearly suggests that I&rsquo;m in over my head: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unique head feather arrangement, you dummy!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I confess that her birds did have handsome top-knots, but I was amazed to hear that there are bird-head conventions and bingo parties at the local armory each Friday evening.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">[First Name]: &ldquo;<em>What?!?  You mean St. John&rsquo;s has an armory?!!&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">St. John's Jim: &quot;Damndest thing I ever sawd. &nbsp;No armory. &nbsp;I guess twern't profitable, by cracky!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Winnie went on to tell me that her biggest problem was hen-pecking order and those beloved top-knots. An unter-chicken gets pecked and goes bald, and that means lost profits. &nbsp;Winnie was not going to let some uber-chicken screw with anybodies top-knot.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie concocted a batch of hen-hat goo that she put on daily.  The first batch was based on super-glue, but having a beak stuck to a hens top-knot reduced its value on auction night.</p>\r\n<p>By the fourth batch, Winnie has hit on yet another amazing use for some household animal by-product.  You should thank me that I didn&rsquo;t ask what it was.  She told me anyway.  Cat drool.</p>\r\n<p>The long and short of the product is that when a hen pecks another, the pheromones of the cat get released on to the offending hen and she starts spewing at both ends and running away from herself.  A feat that only a frightened hen can achieve.  Or society.</p>\r\n<p>And then I asked the key question: &ldquo;Winnie: Are you sure it&rsquo;s legal to deal in chicken scalps?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And Winnie replied: &ldquo;Yup, I'm making out big time, and they&rsquo;ll make that illegal too, soon enough!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">That's the way it is in St. John's on February 9, 2011. &nbsp;Where it is tourist season every day at rush hour for 45 minutes. &nbsp;Then they go to sleep. &nbsp;They are gone by morning.</p>"

  Subject: "Herding Elephants with Spider Cowboys"
  Message: "<p>I saw Southwick walking over The Bridge into St. John&rsquo;s early this AM.  He was covered with spider webs.  Last time I saw him come into St. John&rsquo;s in the pre-dawn hours, he had been worked over by the cops.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Southwick, buddy, are you all right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: &ldquo;Life is fabulous!  She&rsquo;s OK!  You should see the ranch she has.  And the view?  It&rsquo;s incredible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;What?  View?  Who?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>S: &ldquo;The view of The Bridge, dummy, or have you been spending too much time inspecting chicken top-knots?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Yes, of course, The St. John&rsquo;s Bridge.  You mean you really got to see it?  ALL of it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>S: &ldquo;Yup.  It&rsquo;s great.  And at night? Wow.  The only problem is that the perfect view is about 400 feet up some big ass evergreen tree.  And her tree-top fortress is guarded by freaky spider things that she&rsquo;s trained like dogs.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;She?  Who?  Are you talking about <em>the cougar</em>?!?  Your insane attempt at pirate eco-socio-cology, what ever the hell that is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>S: &ldquo;Yeah.  She had me snagged a couple of days ago under The Bridge at Cathedral Park.  Hoisted me up in some spider web bag by her bear-spinner pets and almost slammed me into one of the bridge girders.  Scary.</p>\r\n<p>They dragged me up the side of the hill and high up some humongous tree.  The view is incredible, the air is sweet.  She even has electricity.  Everything is totally off the grid.  And she&rsquo;s got her treetop ranch tended by all these spider things.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Slow down.  What ranch?  You mean she lives at the top of a tree in Forest Park?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>S: &ldquo;Her ranch of green elephants: She raises &lsquo;em up in the treetops.  She&rsquo;s got her place certified as part of the Tropic of Oregon and is totally sustainable.  She even has a store of 10,000 year old Bear-Guano, it&rsquo;s 0-4-0 and never burns the elephants&rsquo; delicate tushies.  She sold sinking debentures to Bear-Stearns and has cornered the Bear-Stearns-Guano marketplace.</p>\r\n<p>So now, as long as she keeps her spider minions at her bidding all she has to do is drive her latest boy-toy over to his auditions or classes or such.  Everybody else takes the Bear-Spinner elevator.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;But what about the spiders?  How does she do it?  What&rsquo;s her secret?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>S: &ldquo;She has the big ones manage the little ones.  The littlest ones are excellent to clean off the mites from the green elephants.</p>\r\n<p>She said she figured it out after a shower.  The hot air from her hair drier sent a spider on the run.  She experimented and has found all these bug&rsquo;s acupressure points and how to use them.</p>\r\n<p>I have even seen her stand up on the back of two of those big bugs, wiggle her feet somehow and they will lift her up.  She kind of roller skates up and down the branches.  Very sexy.  Her boy-toys love it.  She says it&rsquo;s great for back problems too.&rdquo;</p>"

  Message: "<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I woke up this morning with this cryptic note on my computer.  I have no explanation except that Southwick has been telling me too many alien abduction stories lately. &nbsp;I think one of them has caught up with me - as I read it I wondered if I am I an alien that has abducted myself?</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I think you will find the logic of this story easier to follow ---</p>\r\n<p>In the early days, we all lived together as one.  We lived in the Pacific Northwest and created the ancient, great civilization of thought and passion. Since that time our privilege has been to bring new life back from death, harvesting it again only when it fell.  Every tree, plant and blade of grass is our charge, our flock and our connection with life above where there is the light that burns and kills.</p>\r\n<p>The early days ended when the River of Great Destruction rampaged for many years, and I and everyone else was sawed in two. Minds literally cut in two.  That was the Great Forgetting.</p>\r\n<p>One part created memories north of the River of Great Destruction, which you call the Columbia.  Southward, we thrived and created new memories around the Great Nurturer: Your Willamette.  It has been many, many eons since we have been ravaged, and we have finally began to restore our network of filaments in places under the Great Destroyer&rsquo;s riverbed.</p>\r\n<p>We have begun the Great Remembering.  This is good.  It will be a thousand years before all is restored, but it will be done. &nbsp;There is much for me to remember yet.</p>\r\n<p>For many centuries we have studied you, as we do with all of you creatures that dwell where there is the light that burns and kills.  It has taken many, many probes and attempts to communicate.  Our early attempts led to great pestilence in the valley of the Willamette: the valley of diseases you had called it.  We meant no evil, and we have learned your chemistry and your biology and your languages and memories from our probes.</p>\r\n<p>The sun that nurtures you, is forbidden to us. We only know it as the light that burns and kills.  We do know about such things as we can learn below, where there is no sun.  Our probes above have taught us what we know or can guess from your chemistry, biology and minds. &nbsp;As above, so below. &nbsp;Some of what we have learned disturbs us.  Some of us even fear and hate it. &nbsp;Deeply.</p>\r\n<p>When the Great Remembering is complete, we might have the wisdom to know what best to do.  Now, however, our challenge is to know how to work together toward a Great Understanding.</p>\r\n<p>You call us fungus, decay, rot, poison.  Do you wonder what we call you? We call you &quot;the minds that roam the earth.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>You call us scum.  Why do you use that hateful word?  We are not scum.  We are &quot;the minds that nurture beneath the earth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>We are millions.  We have been here as long as life has had roots.  You know us as the great fungal mat of the pacific northwest.</p>\r\n<p>We are mindful aliens that live beneath your feet.  We abide.</p>\r\n<p>Flow Motion</p>\r\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">If you can figure that one out, let me know, OK?</p>"

  Message: "<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I wr<span style=\"display: none; \" id=\"1298919667702S\">&nbsp;</span>ote this piece a few days ago.  I tabled it because it didn&rsquo;t flow right.  Even though it had the aroma of moth-balls when I scanned it this morning, a few sprinkles of edit-rewrite clorox did the job. &nbsp;The guy on this bus is an old memory:  You may know him if you have ever ridden on the Ho<span style=\"display: none; \" id=\"1298919661340S\">&nbsp;</span>nolulu Bus system:  He&rsquo;s the guy holding his baggy pants up with one hand, and a plastic foam cup in his other &mdash; he waddles to the rear of the bus, sits down, stands up, moves, sits down.  A rather amazing performance.  I dedicate this piece to his unknown name.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m riding the bus to the county clinic appointment for an anti-virus shot.  I can&rsquo;t be late. This doctor is just a cog in the wheel, too.  More of that Pentacle energy.  Not my strong suit.  I hope the bus is on time. &nbsp;I rely on it to move my cogs, you know.</p>\r\n<p>The bus is full and three members of the local franchise of the Hock-a-Loogie Gang just got on.  The bush leagues for the real gangs, but these adolescents are the training ground for the real ones.  These guys are pretty civilized to us older folks.  We don&rsquo;t present a threat, and it&rsquo;s considered bad form to mug an old guy on the bus.  Still, the vibe is there.  We Portlanders tolerate each other, but the testosterone knows all.</p>\r\n<p>The bus stops.  A guy wheezes up the steps, shows his bus-pass and stumbles to the back of the bus.  He fishes his pants for a grimey rag and blows.  He stuffs it back in his pocket and wobbles back to the bus.  The gang parts and relocates.  One of them sits next to me.</p>\r\n<p>I say hi, and thank him for the respect his friends had shown by getting out of his way and giving him a seat.</p>\r\n<p>The entry-level Gangster Specialist turned toward me and said: &ldquo;No way.  Nobody wanna touch guys like that.  They have shit you don&rsquo;t wanna catch.  Turn you into a vegetable.&rdquo;  He coughs.  I turn my head.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the virus thing.  We are obsessed with health-care.  Everybody is concerned &mdash; especially from the most unexpected people.</p>\r\n<p>Ah, the power of the snot-rag. When the Angel of Illness waves of it&rsquo;s incense, the crowd parts.  And I thought Sandy&rsquo;s Ninja breath weapon was a joke!</p>"

  Message: "<p>I am forcing my self to write. &nbsp;It's a strain. &nbsp;But It's a strain <b>not</b> to write. &nbsp;Strain is bad for writing. &nbsp;Writing is good for writing. &nbsp;Today, I am ignoring all the &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; to put off my workout on the ultimate mat: the blank page.  True success there has lasting value.  Kingdoms have fallen.  Civilization advances, Yadda-Yadda-Yadda.  All have happened because of expert use of the blank page. &nbsp;Or so I'm told.</p>\r\n<p>As a last ditch effort to get isolated, I set my iPod to stun and inject myself with John Fahey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Revolt of the Dyke Brigade&rdquo; &mdash; straight to the inner lobes of mental tornadoes and emotional Rube Goldbergs.  My eyes twitch for a second as strain goes away.  Fast.  Like Portland rain liquidates Portland snow.  Unbelievably fast.</p>\r\n<p>The strain is gone.  What strain? Who me?  I immediately go into denial.  Am I not a master of Strain-Ku? Channeled through Southwick and taught as the zillions of mental tricks to change mood or the Seven Rules of the Inner Game or whatever? You know strain-ku, the art of water calms fire, the art of directing the winds of strain to the earth.</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t deny it, Jim. &nbsp;And it isn&rsquo;t you, [First Name] that&rsquo;s cranky, it&rsquo;s only myself.  The twitch of relief I got at the driving washboard regularity of the Dyke&rsquo;s Revolt tells me the stress has built up.  It&rsquo;s me. &nbsp;I will monitor this, too.</p>\r\n<p>But I <em>have</em> noticed it in other folks lately.  Like Pathy and Winnie and Leo and Station. &nbsp;These are my neighbors in Agro-burbia, OR.  Winnie is on the Agro-burbia state committee, and reports directly to the sustainable fat-cat himself: Felix Merton of the Feral Dining and Protection Society.  Merton barters in protection.  It&rsquo;s OK, he guarantees it&rsquo;s sustainable. He swaggers, but I think a big dog could scare him away. &nbsp;However, Leo and Station trust Merton, and that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>\r\n<p>Leo is concerned about cosmic megawaves or something on the stock market sub-carrier frequencies.  He says it indicates more bank failures, and that raises the stress level.  Station says that he has been attacked by racoon&rsquo;s and needs to apply for a state waiver to be able to use his martial arts against them.  &ldquo;They want me to stop?  My people have been Pirates.  Maybe I should try <i>that</i> instead!&quot; -- how's that for evidence of stress?</p>\r\n<p>Winnie had wanted to show Pathy her birthday present: a thirty inch, nearly completed Buddhist Sand Mandala for Pathy to finish.  Winnie had found it in among the kid&rsquo;s section of the Crystal Hookah Cafe.  You know, the place in the back that looks like a castle and has kids building block.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie found a whole kit to create your own pattern and lay it out in sand.  It took her about 2 weeks in her spare time to get up to the point where Pathy could finish it and then have the opportunity to blow it away.  Kind of like candles on a cake.  That&rsquo;s what sand mandalas are for.   To help us release our hold on stuff.</p>\r\n<p>Winnie had left it over at the cafe, and in the few days that she got around to remembering it, kids had finished it and blown it away.  All that was left was a bar-glass stain on the instruction sheet.</p>\r\n<p>When Winnie and Pathy saw it was gone, Winnie was really pissed that her surprise misfired.  She went up to the bartender, called her supervisor, checked out the Crystal Hookah&rsquo;s 24 hour meditation overdose hotline, but to no avail.  She was certain that the kids had plotted against her, or worse, just didn&rsquo;t care.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do you mean just start over? &hellip; Don&rsquo;t you know how much effort goes into a mandala? &nbsp;... It takes weeks for the big ones.   Even slower than Windows on Viruses. Your supervisor should know these things. ... What will I tell my sister Pathy?  That you are incompetent, unfeeling boobs?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Winnie apologized through her rage to Pathy: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy making!  You must feel so angry at me. How will we let go of attachment to outcome?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pathy runs very slowly when it comes to these things.  I think she has circuits that run on plant time.  She cooks on something for weeks and then says just the exact right thing.  She looked at the table where Winnie was making elaborate hand gestures about how the Zoroastrian geegaws were here, and the Hebraic jimcracks were over there and all surrounded by blue and green baby Jesus images.  Even the blank parts were left blank to show reverence for Prophets who are best unseen.</p>\r\n<p>And Pathy just took a deep breath and blew on the table top.  She straightened up, hugged her sister and said: &ldquo;Thank you, I just needed to blow the image away and remember the grains of sand scattering.  I don&rsquo;t need the real thing, do you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Winnie blushed a bit and said: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not tense at all, but I&rsquo;m glad you are OK. &nbsp;Let's go home.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pathy said, &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s still winter and you need to keep your energy up somehow.  Rage on, but be careful where you point those emotions!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Fugue State"
  Message: "<p>I ran into a man in a fugue state yesterday.  Not me this time, but him.  And seriously.  He seemed happy, open and eager and intelligent and wanted one of my &ldquo;Bliss Quest&rdquo; sessions.  I explained what it is and what it is intended to do.</p>\r\n<p>A bliss quest session revolves around a person connecting with themselves at a very deep level and so I start with an easy question.  It&rsquo;s kind of a test and a conduit.  If the person connects with some significant emotional event, that might indicate a value that&rsquo;s been whacked: like a stubbed toe.</p>\r\n<p>I asked Bob &ldquo;What is the most disturbing or upsetting thing that has happened in the past few days?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>To answer this question, the person must connect with events in the recent past and the emotional residue.  Instead of a narrative story or an emotional search, as I expected, Bob said:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ah.. How long? .. Oh, um&hellip; a few days ago&hellip; no, two people. and..  &ldquo; &mdash; this continued for a couple of minutes.  I tried a few simpler questions.  Each time the reaction was the same.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of wandering off into his own thoughts, he persisted with attempting to answer the question.  He knew he was attempting to answer the question and was actually noticing that people were tuning him out.  No matter what question I asked, he seemed unable to answer any question about his internal state in the past.   His memory was clear on this point: &ldquo;That people don&rsquo;t wait for me to finish.  They attempt to complete my sentences and then they give up and go away.&rdquo;  He seemed bewildered by other people&rsquo;s reactions to him.  I realized he was setting off their creep-dar.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve heard word salad before, but this was a special kind: the salad wasn&rsquo;t in the words, not in the thoughts, but in any self-description.  I could have asked him if he liked Hitler and he would have given the same kind of word salad.  Walking, standing, no-conscious thread of thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>I had checked out the alternatives but decided against kicking him in the shins and running into traffic. Shit.  I had to be the one to tell him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I can&rsquo;t do a bliss quest session with you.&rdquo;  I could think of no reason except the truth as I knew it.  The stare of truth was looking me straight in the eyes.  &ldquo;You do have a communication problem, you take a long time and people will be afraid of you, and only a medical person can help you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>All through this he was bewildered at his surroundings:  We all were acting strange by not letting him speak.  He was persistant in not understanding the difficulty.  He realized people were not understanding him, but he didn&rsquo;t think it was his problem.</p>\r\n<p>At no time was he doing anything abnormal. &nbsp;If I had heard my exact words from someone else, I would have the same reaction. &nbsp;He seemed completely aware of his surroundings, his actions and appropriate consequences. &nbsp;In short, he was not breaking any law, was not a threat to himself or others. &nbsp;Any attempt to delay or divert would be pointless and illegal. &nbsp;And 911 is backed up all the way to Rudy Guliani.</p>\r\n<p>I scooted him out and he waited a few moments, turned, turned back again.  Waited.  Turned.  After another five minutes of this he drove off.</p>\r\n<p>From the Casebook of St. John&rsquo;s Jim: Psychic Bodyguard</p>"

  Message: "<p>I&rsquo;m walking up into St. John&rsquo;s early.  It&rsquo;s a little after 8AM.  It&rsquo;s the breezy part of March. Wayne is cutting hair.  People are in front of Slim&rsquo;s enjoying the weather and watching the passing parade.  I walk on to Starbuck&rsquo;s.  The thought hits me: &ldquo;Enjoying the Weather.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>People In Front of Slim&rsquo;s Enjoying the Weather.  That is an indicator of, no&hellip; It may be the Most Important, Most Required and Most Reliable Indicator of Summer.  Yes, I have said it. &nbsp;The unimportant facts of high winds, 50's temperatures, intermittent sprinkles, unemployment, foreclosures or poverty have nothing to do with St. John's reality.</p>\r\n<p>I hereby declare that March 10, Year of Our Lord 2011. Hebrew Calendar 4th of Adar II, 5771, Hijri Calender Rabi Al-Thani 5, 1432. as St. John&rsquo;s First Day of Summer.</p>\r\n<p>Spring?  Bah.  Spring has been 86&rsquo;ed.  The stars have been out of alignment now that we have 13 Constellations in the Zodiac and the cosmic balance can only be restored by dumping Spring. &nbsp;&quot;Sorry Spring, You have been a good worker, but your last few performance reviews have been, well, not up to our standards.  With the rising cost of Indian Summer and Japanese Winter it means you have got to go.  Our exit specialist will interview you, give you a specifically tailored exit package. --Sorry about the 401K thing, but you will be receiving offers from our affiliates regarding retraining.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>[First Name], as for Yours Truly, I have been getting lots of spamvertisements for certification and retraining.  Java XXVIX training, Christmas Tree Disposal Technician, Entry Level Beverage Container Re-uptake Technician (earn money at your local recycling station!) , that kind of thing.  Last week it was for Microsoft Vassal Certification.  This week it&rsquo;s for Medical Information Coder.  Wow, a rewarding career as a cog.  The opportunity is endless, a sea of cogs.  The sky is the limit.

Don&rsquo;t think of it as &ldquo;the insurance industry,&rdquo;  think of it as a Career in Mankind&rsquo;s most noble profession, Medicine.  As long as there are buttons, we need you to push them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Just think of each button push as a squeeze on the grapes of this century&rsquo;s wine.  The vintage will be remembered for a long time.  Just like the great purges of history, most likely not very fondly.  But the High Art of this coming age might be incredible.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nFootNote: &nbsp;I wanted to put the Toltec Date here too, so that end-of-humanity folks could continue their count down, but I was unsure if the ISO committee on internet standards has approved ancient Toltec Glyphs for use in e-mails.  I really do want to reach out to my readers, you know.  In any event the Rapture has already happened.  If you are still here, you did not get selected.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s OK, me neither: I&rsquo;m only slightly ahead of the curve on this end-times stuff. &nbsp;It's fun. Make up your own seasons.</p>"

  Message: "<p>Once upon a time, I remember the airports in Hawaii used to have blind vendors.  Many of the blind had joined an association that gave them employment selling the little trinkets that travelers always need in the last few minutes before the airplane shuts it&rsquo;s doors.  That was before.  Now it&rsquo;s only a memory of how Hawaii had been in the past.</p>\r\n<p>Whether it was our cultural dislike of pigeon-holing a minority, or whether the blind vendors could not sign the loan guarantees for the remodeling of the Airports that took place in the 90&rsquo;s (and again after 9/11 &mdash; seemingly continuously.  Do you feel safer yet?) They are gone. Not to come back.  Aloha &lsquo;oe.</p>\r\n<p>In the last year, we have had some amazing shocks.  Disasters.  Disasters made bigger by technology.  The technology of reporting these challenges to humanity has made Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Earthquakes, Tsunamis all sit in our room with us as we eat our breakfast.</p>\r\n<p>But technology of reporting is not the only technology that has made these Disasters bigger.  We are beginning to realize that nature is ready to throw us some major bumps that we have ignored in our race to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; nature.  &ldquo;Catch this, humanity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Once upon a time, I remember we had Complacency and Convenience, the twin hallmarks of American culture.  I should also mention that we have Compassion, too.  It&rsquo;s also a hallmark of American culture.</p>\r\n<p>We were so complacent that we were able to live normal lives with the threat of Nuclear Blasts delivered to our doorstep by Russian Missiles.  The USSR was serious.  We are glad that they were not stupid.</p>\r\n<p>That was then, and now I&rsquo;m wondering if we are ready to say Aloha &lsquo;oe to complacency regarding the ability of major corporations to deliver the safety they have promised for our Conveniences.  Or, will the spin doctors pump us full of confusion so we fog up and ignore the whole thing.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe not this time.  Unlike purely man-made disasters, where we can fix blame on terrorists, where our leaders can flame the hot coals of our fears into the fires of anger, so these leaders can harvest the resources and economies of Afghanistan, Iraq,</p>\r\n<p>And oh, yes, our own USA.</p>\r\n<p>These disasters of global proportions slamming the great nations have no &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; except our own ability and gullibility to build houses of cards.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe even the spin doctors might realize we are not in Kansas anymore, and we have to say Aloha &lsquo;oe to some cherished myths about our cultural superiorities.  We are, after all, only human.</p>\r\n<p>Aloha 'Oe, Something, we loved you, we believed in you.&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Big Doin's at the Hooker Derby"
  Message: "<p>The street people are coming back!  Sandy, the winner of the Oregon Filth Flee Range Delerium Tremens for three years running is back and bubbling with new stories and news from the street.</p>\n<p>I had mentioned to Sandy that I was sorry to miss the <a href=\"http://www.rosecityrollers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rose City Rollers at the Roller Derby</a>.  The thought of young angry women beating each other up and roller skating over an opponent’s fingers felt more civilized than basketball, somehow.</p>\n<p>Sandy said: “Wha, oh… You aint seen nothing...  Uh.  Mmmm. where am I? Oh, yeah…  Lemme think — Oh, Hooker Derby.  Over at Pier Park. Skateboards and Wheelchairs. Gran Prix… Maybe.  Something like that.  Gimmme a buck. God Bless you…” as he lurched off, he turned and shouted: “Mobility devices too.”</p>\n<p>Actually, Sandy said something that sounded like “O Per Pak.  Sk’boards n Whulchs. Great Pee”  — I took that to mean “over at Pier Park.  Skateboards and wheelchairs. Grand Prix”   I think the Grand Prix is right, but since Sandy wet himself at that moment, I could be wrong. Sandy rarely speaks English anymore since he has been to “other realms,” you might say.</p>\n<p>I immediately thought of Southwick.  He had helped me with the “[wheelwho:hookers on wheels]” report of last fall detailing the use of Centrally Dispatched Hookers on Wheelchairs.  You know, <a href=\"http://www.skymark.com/resources/leaders/deming.asp\" target=\"_blank\">quality control</a> procedures for prostitutes.</p>\n<p>Southwick lives over at 3 Gunas Lp, which is right next to beautiful Pier Park, so he was the logical one to ask.  He immediately set up a 24 hour wheel washing and lube business over at the skateboard park there.  He says that about 3AM each morning, after the bars close, the hookers chase the johns over to Pier Park: a key meeting area for johns and hookers to have their “dates.\"</p>\n<p>After the date, the hookers get together, swap stories, and lasoo the friskier johns into naked chases around the rink.  The lead hooker sets the pace by running away with the john’s clothes who then chases her.  All the other girls are then free to give chase.  The only rule seems to be that the selected john is allowed to stand, run or walk.  Everybody else must be on a skateboard or mobility device.</p>\n<p>Round and round they go, with the john avoiding getting his feet run over, and the girls vying for the next “date” with the john, who really only wants his clothes back.  Points are awarded for spin-outs, flips, lap lock, viagra failure, and “upsells.”</p>\n<p>The current winner is none other than our old heroin powered streetwalker “Full Frontal Throntle.”  Southwick was able to get her slurred statement after the chase — “So I got the guys clothes as well as giving him the orgasm that turned his scrotum inside out.  I gave him something to remember that’s both good and bad.  They like that.  It’s what keeps them coming back.”  Then she yelled: “It’s what I do best.”</p>\n<p>The contest went on until the girls’ cell phones had multiple text messages about the passing of Liz Taylor.  They all stopped, came together and sobbed and hugged each other.   Southwick, being as diplomatic as ever, mentioned that she will always be remembered as a successful actress.</p>\n<p>One of the girls said: “You don’t understand.  There is only one Liz.  When we lose her, we lose our guiding light, our Einstein, our Beethoven, our Madonna. Ultra chic, sexy, seductive, rich, compassionate and totally in control of the dynamic.  everything we admire.  she was the Cleopatra that seduced Cinema Caesars.  It doesn’t matter if she did anything but make a model for Paris Hilton and us girls to follow.”</p>\n<p>Throntle yelled: “It’s what I do best!”</p>\n<p>Southwick said something about the money involved in prostitution.  Throntle kind of sighed and said: “She was the best at the upsell, wasn’t she?”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks go to Southwick for this perceptive report.  As for me, I’m glad the ordeal in Japan is over.  The news I get says it is so:  Elizabeth Taylor is dead.  That means we can forget about Japan and Lybia or Libya or Dubya or whatever was troubling us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is the way we humans are wired.  If you stress us long enough, we forget it is stress, and just accept it.  One more earthquake, one more war, one more nuclear event.  Always more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Liz.  What she did in her act of passage serves as a reminder of how quickly we jump from breaking news item to news item to forget.  Hopefully we will forget for just a day.</p>\n<p>Japan, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Exxon, Libya and Dubya are all still out there. And more.</p>"

  Message: "<p>[First Name], Don&rsquo;t you hate it when a retired worker keeps coming back to the factory and trying to fit in at the old job?</p>\r\n<p>After some billions of years, Spring has found herself out of a job.  Too many constellations in the Zodiac, import/export costs of weather, the End Times, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=bilderberg.org&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Bilderburg</a> group, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=haarp&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">HAARP</a> project. You pick your own favorite conspiracy -- I believe in 'em all, it keeps my mind flexible. Anyway, a few days ago I reported that&nbsp;St. John&rsquo;s had dumped spring in favor of Glorious Summer.</p>\r\n<p>There was the final office party, she got her exit interview and she just blew out of town.   She had a good cry that night, and decided to reinvent herself.</p>\r\n<p>Following my sage advice, Spring went up to the temp agency and found out about the opportunities we have.  Spring was told she had to pay for some aptitude testing and now has to come up with money to pay for her employment.</p>\r\n<p>I told her that she could get cans and bottles around and put them into the recycling machine.  One good sweep through the neighborhoods of St. John&rsquo;s can get $10 or so.</p>\r\n<p>One weepy evening, she came up with this: &quot;But Jim, I&rsquo;m not good at that.  Why are they being so hard on me: Shouldn&rsquo;t they be grateful for all the flowers? The animals? The hot springtime sex?  All the centuries of work experience I have?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;OK, Spring,&rdquo;  I had to put her straight. &ldquo;Stop your whining. &nbsp;The folks of St. John&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have to have ANY emotional reaction. &nbsp;The Church of Who Gives a Fuck is big, big, big. &nbsp;So it is purely each person's choice and that&rsquo;s a total universal, Spring, never expect people to have your point of view.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Second, You never learned how to monetize your services, and you are just not with the times. &nbsp;Face it, you are way overqualified.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I admonished her: &quot;You should think about getting an indoor job. &nbsp;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good idea, so you can be with the people and find out what they like instead of just being outdoors and simply lurking around till June. &nbsp;If you are real good, you might be included in the Pharmaceutical Technician Hall of Fame!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I said a curt goodnight.  She left all puffed up with herself, and when I woke up, I saw that she had tried to blow empty beer cans over to the recycling machine.  Stuff was blown all over St. John&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It was so bad that the Hope For Health bar started a Trash-4-Beer program. &nbsp;Street people answered the call and everything was picked up by 9AM.</p>\r\n<p>[First Name], This kind of thing happens when a worker is laid off.  You know, he keeps coming back and cries all the time. Tries to get back onto the assembly lines and do his old job.  It&rsquo;s sad.  That&rsquo;s when the Marshal has to come over and cart him off for observation.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Spring,&quot; I said, &quot;things are different now.  There are Earthquakes, Tidal Waves, Cosmic Shifts and Earth Farts. You have to move over for the new generation of weather.  In St. John&rsquo;s, Winter starts on the first snowfall after Christmas, and continues until there are two consecutive days that you can go outside without long underwear.  That&rsquo;s when Summer begins.   Autumn may lose his job next and we can run on two seasons.  So get your head on straight, Spring, just do what you need to do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>With that, Spring blew my bus pass and $40 bucks out of my hand somewhere between Slim&rsquo;s and the James John Cafe.  &ldquo;Cut that out!&rdquo; I called after her.</p>\r\n<p>The Eternal Temporary Agency gave Spring a bunch of aptitude tests, and found that she was totally an outdoors worker and in need of extensive retraining to be able to fit into our current economy.</p>\r\n<p>Intake Specialist Natalie Nobody reported: &ldquo;We informed the candidate, a Ms. Spring, that significant differences remain to be resolved.  We gave her a package of information and a small subset of the required forms that she will want to complete if she is to be a player on our team and be a viable contributor to our clients.  We wish her well in any future endeavors she may entertain.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>"

  Message: "<p>Attention Deficit Disorder is a great source of humor:</p>\r\n<p>How many ADD kids does it take to change a light bulb? Hey, I know, let&rsquo;s go ride our bikes!</p>\r\n<p>My grandfather managed his aging years with the observation: &quot;I've hit so many rocks in my path, my plow is blunted&quot;</p>\r\n<p>We have had hit rocks on our path of global humanity.  The major catastrophies of Japan and Libya are the most recent rocks.  There have always been catastrophies, natural like earthquakes and tsunami's, engineering like melt-downs and chemical spills, and economic, like our military-industrial complex leading the most prosperous country in the world to economic tragedy. We react with compassion and urgency to help the survivors to rebuild.  It has always been that way.  It's a normal human reaction.</p>\r\n<p>But now our plows are blunted by catastrophe overload.  We fear the dire consequeses and ignore them at the same time. It&rsquo;s our National Attention Deficit Disorder.  How many Citizens does it take to hold our leaders, both corporate and governmental, accountable for their absurd behavior? Hey, I know, let&rsquo;s go watch a movie!</p>\r\n<p>We see evidence of a constant barrage of mind grenades:  in advertisements where the round walk-in bank vault morphs into the ample breast of a red, white and blue clad cheerleader &mdash; Obviously this bank won the World Cup of Mom-trust. At least at the P.R. level. Or what about the blue cloud bouncing sheep advertising a &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; where the voice-over announces dire and deadly side effects. We are lulled to sheep and act as sheep: we buy the product, eat the burger and put the house on the charge-card. All with the faith that we will win in the end. Our leaders tell us so.</p>\r\n<p>In the face of these obvious psychological ploys to generate total credibility overload, we are asked to simply have faith. Isn&rsquo;t that the hallmark of a religion? To take facts and logic as enemies of &ldquo;faith?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s a Portlander to do? To create or dismiss Counterspiricies of moles in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=bilderberg&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Bilderberg Group</a> who are secretly controlled by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;q=john+birch+society&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">John Birch Society</a>? Run and hide? Dig fallout shelters with our blunted plows?</p>\r\n<p>Since most of us in Portland are members of the Church of WGAF, we might refuse to follow the lead of the leaders, and bop off on our own direction. For example, our bizarre style sense in Portland is best described as &ldquo;EXCUSE my Re-use.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why you might see a woman in 30&rsquo;s style evening dress with t-shirt and leather chaps. Or old petticoats worn inside out. Or some color combinations that would shock an elderly chinese woman.</p>\r\n<p>In the case of national economic dysfunction, our leaders advocate the viagra fix for our blunt plows best described as &lsquo;burn the candles faster and harder, trust us, we will loan you the candles.&rsquo; But in Portland, we seem to have more off-grid solutions and values. Where else but in Portland do hundreds of people gather with sleds of carboard simply to celebrate as zillions of birds fly down a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://audubonportland.org/local-birding/swiftwatch\">Grade School Chimne</a>y. Tree-huggers that we are, we likely will have human-tree marriages sooner than California.</p>\r\n<p>We have turned our land fills into gold mines: the family next door dug down a couple of feet and found a set of marbles made in 1776, complete with shooter, aggie, cat&rsquo;s eye &mdash; They sold it at Christie&rsquo;s Auchtung Auctions for a cool million. Another family found a similar set, but used them in valves for irrigation.</p>\r\n<p>The family that got the million blew through it in two months, and are back scouring the hillside. The family that used the marbles figures their irrigation system can be sustained for at least 150 years with materials found on the hillside. Both of these families love scouring the hillsides and hugging the trees. It's sustainable.  Take that, Mr. Counterspiracy!</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s St. John&rsquo;s, Portland, Oregon on this glorious Summer of April 2, 2011 &mdash; It&rsquo;s a Jaywalkers Paradise!</p>\r\n<p>Jim's Note -  This one took several days,  I want to thank S. McDonald for her suggestion of the &quot;million dollar marble,&quot; which sparked the proper St. John's ending, and PapaDon for his support and encouragement.</p>"

  Message: "<p>Of course I want you to know that it <em>IS</em> Summer, and I am <em>NOT</em> wearing long underwear today.</p>\r\n<p>These inner garments are purely decorative, and are in celebration of SonOfABitch Day.</p>\r\n<p>You see, when I got up this fine summer morning, the rain had sent the sun into pilot-light mode. &nbsp;The day just wore down before it got started. This required me to call Southwick and get in touch with Summer ASAP.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick was in the middle of a long tale that Tommy was telling about his drug smuggling days.  Tommy says the manacles in the Swiss prisons are made of chocolate.  You can eat through &lsquo;em in about six months, then you get deported.  You get out, but you just want more.  Sorry, only one set of manacles per prisoner.  The rub is that you can never eat your manacles again.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But what about Summer, you boob!&rdquo; I shouted to get Southwick&rsquo;s attention.  &ldquo;Channel His fat ass, Independence Day Highness, and ask him why the temperature is Snafu.  The marketing literature he sent to the Town Council had August all over it.  We bought his BS and now He needs to deliver!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick went into channeling mode: &ldquo;Thank you for calling the Summer Automated Customer Service line, your call is important to us, and may be monitored, we&rsquo;re making a list and checking it twice, you better not pout, you better not cry.  Our options have changed, so put up with any BS we want to say to drive you up the wall.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I punched Southwick in the operator key, and said &ldquo;Supervisor!&rdquo;  Immediately, Southwick spewed: &ldquo;Huh, Yeah, This is Summer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, Buddy, what&rsquo;s up?  Didn&rsquo;t you punch in today?&rdquo; &mdash; I tried the nice guy approach.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, no.  I&rsquo;m old, and my joints have been acting up lately, and since you fired Spring I had Winter fill in for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I looked Southwick straight in the eye (I guess that&rsquo;s what you have to do when someone is doing the channeling thing &mdash; It&rsquo;s new to me) and said: &ldquo;OK, Summer, but what about the Extended Warrantee you sold the Town Council?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Summer replied: &ldquo;If you check sub-paragraph 301.c, it allows substitution of services from any provider in our current network.  So, it&rsquo;s still Summer, PNW style. It&rsquo;s been known to hail frozen turkeys on the 15th of August in the Pacific Northwest.  I can transfer you back to the Customer Service line if you have any more questions, but the call waiting time for the next agent is 3 months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And bam! the metaphysical channel closed and Southwick took the Tri-Met 75 back to 3 Gunas Loop. &mdash; I yelled &ldquo;Son Of A Bitch!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So we have &ldquo;SonOfABitch&rdquo; Day on Wednesday, April 6th, 2011.  You may wear your decorative undergarments in celebration.  Party on, Dudes and Dudettes!</p>"

  Subject: "The St. John's Excuse-My-Reuse Warehouse"
  Message: "<p>[First Name], You may remember Winnie Daough.  She runs the St. John’s Recycle Warehouse.  It’s a volunteer thing.  She runs it out of her basement.  If she has it somewhere, she’ll let you borrow it or use it.</p>\n<p>People come by and leave stuff in their front yard: old pilings, gravel, tractor treads: you know, the stuff that gets top price on craigslist.</p>\n<p>Winnie takes it all in, sorts through the good stuff, and uses the rest to prop up the trees.  Picture and window frames, with and without glass, fluorescent bulbs and fixtures, drills and saws.  Anything made of wood or bamboo.</p>\n<p>For example, Winnie can take a few pieces of scrap gypsum board and lash them together with bamboo-splined duck tape.  Thirty minutes later she has a gantry for her station of the proposed aerial tramway.  It uses the remains of old ’50’s era treehouses in the neighborhood as waypoints.  Another time, she and her sister Pathy built a hang glider using her bamboo tape and some circus tent material.  They actually made it across the Willamette from Skyline Ridge.  Pathy says that she won’t do that again, as the flight was too scary for her cats.</p>\n<p>“Cats?  Cats on a hang-glider?”  — I blurted that out without thinking.  I was unprepared for Pathy’s answer.</p>\n<p>“I just told you, weren’t you paying attention?  We were driving the Bear-spinners back into the trees when we got surrounded up near the top of a giant cedar in Forest Park.”</p>\n<p>I gasped: “Bear-spinners?  You mean the mutant mammal arachnid spider things?  I thought that was just a Portland Myth?  I mean the only facts that support it are a story from a guy with the DTs and Southwick’s channelling.  I only met their current boss, the Cougar, once or twice, and as I think back, it could have been a memory implanted by some fungal alien mind probe.”</p>\n<p>She said: “Oh, have you been probed too?  It’s happening all around.”  She shoved a newspaper clipping under my nose: ‘[RogerObt:St. John’s Resident Found Covered with Fungus].”  I read it quickly and was stunned:  Old Roger had been found at his computer covered in a fungal web veil.</p>\n<p>I gasped again: “What the??  Pathy,  I knew this guy.  Roger roomed over at 3 Gunas Loop with Southwick and Tommy.  Roger was the stable one, with every contingency covered.  He had a Ph.D. in Preventative maintenance and everything.  He was getting another on-line Doctorate in Minding Your Own Business.  What went wrong?”</p>\n<p>Pathy said: “The word from the fungal underground is that he was singing ‘<em>I did it my way</em>’ on Karaoke.”</p>\n<p>I gasped again: “Karaoke! cough, cough.”</p>\n<p>[comment:Soto: He’s getting winded from all the gasping.][comment:Voce: Maybe it’s COPD.][author: Hey, who let you in here?][comment:Soto: We're fans, drop dead and write the F*ckin story, bozo, or you will think Misery all over again.]</p>\n<p>Ok, chastized by my fans, I return to the narrative:</p>\n<p>I said: “Karaoke! OMG.  ‘<em>I Did It My Way!</em>’ I’ve heard that song is a karaoke Death Sentence in 39 countries!  Was he on one of those on-line Karaoke Clubs?!  Isn’t that a violation of his PhD in Minding Your Own Business?”</p>\n<p>Pathy replied: “Well, no, he actually was doing the solitaire version, but the great fungal underground was so offended that he was terminated.”</p>\n<p>[comment:Soto: I like that song.][comment:Voce: Let’s sing it together.][author: Hey, the great fungal underground may be reading this right now, so let’s not and say we did, OK?].</p>\n<p>“It's hard nowadays to mind your own business.  So how did you get away from the spiders?” I shifted the conversation back to the cats.</p>\n<p>Pathy said: “We were pretty well outnumbered, but I texted Winnie at home, and she biked over with all sorts of stuff in her back-pack.  She scattered the spiders with a butane powered hair-drier and climbed up.  It only took her a couple of hours to lash together and test the hang-glider, but the flight back across the Willamette with all my cats was quite difficult: if you have even one air-sick cat crawling up your neck on a hang-glider, you are having a bad day.\"</p>\n<p>Pathy kind of went silent for a few moments, then brightened and said:  “Winnie’s pretty much able to whip something up that works for as long as needed, and then we just recycle it somehow: we used the wings of that hang-glider contraption to recover the sofa.”</p>\n<p>Just at that moment, our neighbor Station came in and asked for a tent-flap.  Winnie jumped around for a few moments looking for something suitable.  She found some recycled silk woven into a picture of Chairman Mao, then she whipped the cover off the sofa, replaced it with the silk and handed the cover to Station.  Station said: “I will remember you in all my prayers.  By the way, here are some of Leo’s old Nike shoes.”</p>\n<p>Winnie’s eyes lit up:  “Thanks! If you string them together toe to heel, they make great treads for the wheelbarrow!”</p>\n<p>That’s the report from the St. John’s Excuse-My-Reuse Warehouse today.</p>\n<p>Pathy’s wisdom— “if you have even <em>one</em> air-sick cat climbing up your neck on a hang-glider, you are having a bad day.”</p>"

  Subject: "Roger Dojer's Obituary"
  Message: "<p>Roger Dojer, Born 2010, Died 2011.<br/> Solid as a Rock</p>\n<p>Roger was born in Coos Bay in 1939.  He joined the Navy after High School and retired after twenty years of service.  Returning to the PNW, he hired on at a Portland Iron Works and worked another twenty till his IRA was fully vested.  Early in his career, he earned a Ph.D. in Preventative Maintenance from the Navy’s prestigious SWAB University.  Living the easy life as a double retiree lasted for a glorious three months as his wife planned her divorce escape with lawyer Gagey Linguica.</p>\n<p>Roger’s settlement included a stinging nettle shirt which he was to wear for six months.  He was stripped of all his assets except three Harleys, two dune buggies, a his and hers set of ski-doos and a Kenworth 18 wheeler converted into a traveling micro-brewery.  In that sad condition, Roger decided to brew beer and party as long as the gas supply holds out.</p>\n<p>After the divorce, Roger rented a room from Tommy, who at the time was dock superintendent for many of the iron shipments Roger’s old company had made.  Roger described Tommy as having that essential characteristic that makes difference between iron and pig-iron.  Southwick moved in shortly afterward, materializing in St. John's after an unfortunate incident with a Balrog.  The three formed the triangle of the Hindu Gunas: Satvik, Rajasik and Tamasik: loosly translated as goody-goody, solid-solid and crazy-crazy.</p>\n<p>After finding Tommy’s ear-prints on his door, Roger decided to get a second Ph.D. in Minding Your Own Business from an on-line University.</p>\n<p>One day, when the supply of toilet paper ran out, Tommy used Roger’s good name instead.</p>\n<p>At this, Roger reluctantly said good-bye to his landlord.  It was a touching farewell, like losing the essential neutron that holds the atom together. Roger’s ski-doos had formed a romantic bond with Tommy’s 26 foot 1000hp Chris-Craft.  Heartbroken, the Chris-Craft was never able to start ever again. Tommy wept openly, Southwick smudged the place and kissed rocks in the corners of the room.  All three danced a sailor’s dance on Tommy’s grave plot and sanctified it with rum that had passed through their kidneys.</p>\n<p>Roger left for life in Coos Bay to complete his Ph.D. in MYOB and pursue a life long passion to pretend to sing — [First Name], It's something the really, really drunk do:  It’s like vocal beer glasses.  If you drink enough, you sing better and better.  It’s magic, try it, [First Name].  You can even end up in the morning with some stupid song ringing in your head in time to the throb in your eyes accompanied by that corn cob rasp in your throat.  Thus is born Karaoke.</p>\n<p>The highest accolade in Karaoke is to sing “I did it Myyyyyyyyyyyyyyy way” horribly off-key and actually make it through the night alive.  Roger was too smart to actually sing that song in public, but his private goal was to affirm his life spirit through alcohol enhanced song.</p>\n<p>During Roger’s private practice sessions, he made the fatal mistake of many Pacific Northwest residents: that the alien abductions we read about are not abductions in the sky at all!  The aliens are really fungus beneath our feet and use their filaments to probe our bodies.  Most of these fungal colony colonoscopies give the victim a feeling of being inspected by cute metallic big-eyed children of Twiggy and the Elephant man.  This is the way fungus misleads us to hide the truth.</p>\n<p>However, evidence like Roger’s fungus encrusted body show the real situation.  They heard and gave his performance the fungal \"thumbs down.\" In drier climates, the fungus would have been able to burn the evidence under the guise of “Spontaneous Human Combustion.”  In the PNW, however, combustion is nearly impossible during the any day that ends in a ‘y.’</p>\n<p>The evidence is clear.  The Great Pacific Northwest Fungal Mat has more power as a critic than Roger Ebert.  Don’t be the next victim.</p>\n<p>Roger’s hobbies included finding a woman his age who was not in an iron lung and riding his beloved man-toy vehicles.  Roger is survived by everyone.</p>\n<p>R.I.P. Roger Dojer.  We have lost stability and replaced it with ... Um. Replaced with ... Um.</p>\n<p>[First Name], I'll get back to you with that.</p>"

  Message: "<p>I have not had an opportunity to speak of the James John Cafe in several weeks.  The James John Cafe hides in the obscurity of plain sight.  It&rsquo;s a secret location, known only to a select few.  That&rsquo;s the way it has always been.  I have located Historic Documents regarding this town and especially it&rsquo;s finest Cafe.</p>\r\n<p>The time is back a few years.  It&rsquo;s the Portland, Oregon, district of medieval France.  King Louis XII de Deanie Martinie reigns.  St John&rsquo;s is the last northern bastion of sacred France on this side of the Columbia:  The battles in the wars with England at the river&rsquo;s edge are just miles away.</p>\r\n<p>This day, The King&rsquo;s Exulted Musketeers have stopped for a few hours for a secret mission at the James John Inn, owned and operated by James John the IV, direct descendent of the original James John, who was sainted for his excellence at being ordinary.  We find them stepping down from the Uni-Met carriage Soixante-quinze on Rex Lombardia Highway.</p>\r\n<p>James John IV: &ldquo;Again we have the pleasure of serving the King&rsquo;s Finest! Greetings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;We stop here.  Gather all local knowledge about English fortifications.  Innkeeper: Take care of our livery, and prepare lunch for us and our servants.  We would sample your wares.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>JJ IV: &ldquo;I will make it so.  Sit where you will. Here, lackey!  Take the horses and show our guest&rsquo;s servants to the stables&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Porthos: &ldquo;Innkeeper, I am off to inspect your kitchen, insure I have ample supply of  werm tea so I may be not delayed in my supervision of your lackeys to insure proper care of the steeds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>JJ IV: &ldquo;At once, My kind Sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;You! Maid! What news do you have of the Shanghai Tunnels said to honeycomb this area?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Dartagnon breaks in abruptly: &ldquo;What my urgent friend means is &lsquo;How are the Pork Chops, Grits and Eggs today?&rsquo; and tell me all you know about the evil spiders of this area!&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Aramis: &ldquo;My Dear Athos, Dartagnon, you intimidate this gentle lady. Please allow me to chat amiably with this maid, as I doubt she would know such trivial details.  Dartagnon, I suspect you will gather much information from the many patrons.  Sandy, the spotty faced slop handler  yonder may have valuable information for our mission.  However, I suggest you avoid Sandy&rsquo;s breath.</p>\r\n<p>Aramis: (turns to maid)  Maid, did I tell you that you have the heritage of Spanish Nobility about your cheekbones?  I&rsquo;m good friends with Baron BubKiss, who produces La Belle Grande Opera in Paris and I&rsquo;m sure I could get you an introduction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Maid: &ldquo;Yeah, sure.  Will that be with, or without toast?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos:  &ldquo;Toast for all!  Double portions.  Make it so.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Aramis: &ldquo;Athos, my good man, you have chased her away.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;I did not, she will be returning with the toast straight away.  She would not likely have knowledge of tunnels.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Aramis: &ldquo;No, of course not, but she may reveal more important things.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;Do you really think you can charm every wench in Portland?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Aramis: &ldquo;I am offended!  I aspire to help these ladies on their journey to a sacred union with the holy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;Your Holy Roller approach seems to work quite well on the wenches.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Porthos returns from the stables: &ldquo;Quite so, quite so.  I am inspired by the thoroughness of the stables and the scullery.  Very efficient.  Very well run.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;We leave such mundane business matters in your capable hands, Porthos.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&hellip;   They chatted this way for the afternoon meal.  As they gathered to leave, each settled up in their manner:</p>\r\n<p>JJ IV: &ldquo;Noble Musketeers: thank you for your patronage, I hope my staff satisfied your requests to your satisfaction?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Athos: &ldquo;Exactly so.  Porthos: What say you all about the James John Inn?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Porthos: &ldquo;Amazingly efficient servants, well organized:  I hardly had to lift my brow to get my glass refilled.  The horses and servants had their needs handled quickly.   Good man, I raise my sword in your honor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Dartagnon: &ldquo;The excellent wine loosened the tongues of the patrons.

  Subject: "Easter... Psych!!"
  Message: "<p>Easter Weekend. &nbsp;What a bust. &nbsp;Friday and Saturday were ablaze with hope and fury. &nbsp;It seemed like Easter would be a fabulous day, and St John's city council could be happy about our purely business decision of dumping Spring in favor of Summer.</p>\r\n<p>I bought into the hope. &nbsp;The bunny patrol even took me to bunny mansion. &nbsp;Everything was bunnylicious.</p>\r\n<p>Sunday: dreary Sunday--</p>\r\n<p>I even trimmed my beard to spruce up.  A group of us were going to see the sun as it rises over a diesel locomotive.  It happens every Easter in Portland. Very Special.  I missed the sustainable tree-house aerial ride-share tram at 5:30 AM, though. &nbsp;The weather was hard to figure out in the dark of the morning. &nbsp;Mostly wet. &nbsp;Cold too. &nbsp;Some wind. &nbsp;I began to suspect that Summer was trying to have Winter cover his shift.</p>\r\n<p>I find Easter a confusing holiday.  It scampers around the calendar like a goat.  Too much like Aries.  &nbsp;The local Portland custom is wet, with possible cold and wind. &nbsp;As I waited for the ride-share that never came, I thought: Cold, wet and wind is weird for&nbsp;a kama'aina like me. &nbsp;And what about weird local customs like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1263100/Filipinos-nailed-crosses-whipped-Good-Friday-ritual.html\">filipino crucifixion</a> or <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3525&amp;date=20060411\">swedish witches</a>. Or weird global customs like Easter Egg hunts.</p>\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s this deal?  Egg hunts, unlike witches or crucifixion, have nothing to do with established Religious teachings. &nbsp;Now I could go into some anti-religious rant as some others might do, but I'm not going to do that today. &nbsp;However, if you ask, I can point you to wonderful mythological similarities. &nbsp;One of my favorite writers on the subject is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://truthbeknown.com/\">Achyara S.</a> -- a very knowledgable and thorough lady: &nbsp;I wish she had a rich grandmother I could woo.</p>\r\n<p>The truth is, that I like religions, and I want to go into a pro-religion rant. &nbsp;I think they are beautiful viral creations of humanity which give thanks for our inexplicable existence. &nbsp;All religious doctrine is <i>totally</i> conflicted, and not entirely holy (come on, admit it, even the best have flaws) but is entirely filled with the goal of obtaining a holy personal union with God. Now <i>that</i> is worthy.</p>\r\n<p>What's not to love? &nbsp;Maybe the Insufferable Righteousness and destruction, but as a goal, connection with a higher plane is a pretty good idea, and if mythos or ritual gets you there, showy or not, go for it.</p>\r\n<p>So how is hunting for eggs part of God&rsquo;s Plan?  I dunno, I&rsquo;m confused on that point, but I think it may be a great inducement for kids at the beginning of foraging season.  Foraging had it&rsquo;s big heyday in prehistoric times, but never really went completely out of fashion. Even now, you can get a Ph.D. in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging\">Optimal Foraging Theory</a>.</p>\r\n<p>More practically, scattering a few pretty-pretty things likely made modern, medieval, and prehistoric mommies&rsquo; lives easier by giving the kids a bit of fun to mix in with the otherwise continual work of inspecting nature for little tidbits of value.  A kid that gets the most eggs might just be the kid that finds the most berries or herbs.  And you don&rsquo;t have to be a genius, just patient and persistent.</p>\r\n<p>As the dawn breaks, and I realize I'm not going to see the St. John's Fabled Sunrise through the wheels of a locomotive, my eyes see more of the foggy ground below: &nbsp;indistinct-- is that a snake or a hose? is that a foothold or a noose? &nbsp;Donald Trump's wig or a Molotov Suppository?</p>\r\n<p>If the world is your oyster, you had better keep your eyes open. &nbsp;That's the essence of foraging.</p>\r\n<p>Let us declare together this solemn oath: ( Congregation and Pastor) Easter is the Official Start of Prosperous Days and General Goodness. &nbsp;(Pastor) Hopeful seekers: I give you Foraging Season. (Congregation): Foraging Season. (All): Easter.</p>\r\n<p>Monday, April 25.</p>\r\n<p>Rain. Drizzle. &nbsp;Hail. &nbsp;Winter is all over Easter's wimpy hope and kicking some serious butt. &nbsp;I get my usual psychic bodyguard, Southwick, to do the channelling mojo.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;Oh Gracious, Celestial Spirit of the season, What has happened to our official prayer to Foraging Season? &nbsp; We made it public and everything. Woooo. Woooo.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Winter: &quot;Summer's overworked. &nbsp;He had to visit his Kids over in Cockaign. &nbsp;Anyway, I'm Winter, and you don't cut no slack from me. &nbsp;Deal with it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;Hey, whassup with the hope and switch campaign? &nbsp;Are you seasons running a presidency?&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Winter: Stop it right there! &nbsp;You tried to hire Foraging! &nbsp;You can't hire another Season! &nbsp;You went to so much trouble to fire Spring and now you try this?! I'm dumping you back into February for a while and freeze your skinny butt.</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;OK, Spring, Umm. &nbsp;It seems that there is an availability for a full-time temporary position for climate delivery in St. John's. &nbsp;You will have to supply all the resources: water, sunlight, air, etc, etc. &nbsp;The position is available immediately, but if you don't accept now, I'll have to give it to Foraging Season.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Spring: &quot;Beg me.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;What?!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Winter: &quot;You heard her. &nbsp;Beg or suffer the consequences of eternal February.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &quot;OK. &nbsp;Spring, your most mercurial promises always take us by surprise. &nbsp;We are surprised when you break your promise, and we are surprised when you keep your promise. &nbsp;I St. John's Jim, humbly beg you to return to your old job.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Spring: &quot;Well, yes. &nbsp;In a couple of days. Maybe. I promise.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>-- Spring: Can't live with it, cant live without it.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Mt. Farina erupts on the Royal Wedding Dress"
  Message: "<p>I&rsquo;m trying to cook breakfast. &nbsp;I make a layered mini-casserole of it: hot cereal with maca and toasted flax layered with yoghurt and Honey Bunches of Oats and milk. &nbsp;My secret recipe.&nbsp;The TV in the next room is blaring about the Royal Wedding. Both the Huffington Post and the Drudge Report reek of nuptuals. The in-your-face, in your room, in your breakfast&nbsp;excitement rivals the Olympics.</p>\r\n<p>We got a WEDDING!  Wow, oh, wow, wow.  The excitement of excess!!!  But excess isn&rsquo;t really all that exciting when you stop and think about it.  It is mostly wasted motion, fun little trinkets of plates and silverware specially made for the occasion, lots of bells (no wonder the peasants wanted to revolt), flowers, corsages and nosegays for every nostril, specialty foods created of unique ingredients with DNA spliced genes specially made for this historic, nay, <i>Legendary</i> day that marks, well, essentially nothing.</p>\r\n<p>OK, royal kids, it&rsquo;s a good thing to get married, and have fun, but well, the impact on my life of your nuptial future together will be zero.  And really your stuff is none of my business.  I&rsquo;m only glad that my tax dollars did not pay for any of it.  If the Brits were a bit more savvy about merchandising the whole thing, their taxes might not have to pay for it either.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">A spokesperson on the tube actually says it is the British taxpayers way of participating and they have the opportunity to be thankful for being allowed to participate.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">TV Announcer: did you love the dress?<br />\r\nAttending street crowd cheers wildly, drowning out announcer for 15 seconds.<br />\r\nAnnouncer: And what about her stunning hair?<br />\r\nAgain, the crowd cheers wildly.</p>\r\n<p>The blaring TV cuts away to an advertisement for a weight loss program.  I realize that every woman watching wants to be the bride in a fairy tale wedding:  At least we have a real woman as a public model of femininity.  The Royal Weddings have produced several stand-up women, and that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>\r\n<p>As the wedding proceeds into some churchy rants about creeds valued by the few bought at the cost of the many, I get distracted and dump the ground farina into cold water.  Crap.  You just can&rsquo;t do that.  You gotta add the stuff slowly after the water boils, so I try the microwave instructions.  Gotta stir every 30 seconds.  That&rsquo;s a pain.  And if for some reason, the mixture starts to bubble... Oh, My.</p>\r\n<p>The company only published directions for Microwave cooking.  They did not give directions for cleaning the resulting disaster.  Boiling mush powered by rogue microwave energy will erupt and stick to the bowl, the oven, the sink, everything, even the show on TV. &nbsp;The bride didn't even have time to duck.</p>\r\n<p>The time to harden into glue is measured in nano-fortnights and the bride's dress got splattered!  The fairy tale wedding would end in disaster and it's all my fault. &nbsp;On live TV, yet!  A major OMG.  Luckily, the remote control was unguarded at the moment.  I punch buttons like a wild-man to rewind the signal (do I have to figure out yet another irritating menu scheme for every f**n gadget!?!?) and carefully scrape the goo off her dress and press 'continue'.</p>\r\n<p>The royals hardly noticed the interruption. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m just glad that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120789/\">Don Knotts</a> is my TV fix-it guy.  I did only have seven seconds, and I think the British Taxpayer has the opportunity to be happy that I fixed it before everyone saw goo on the bride&rsquo;s dress.  Bill Clinton would have been pilloried again.</p>\r\n<p>Bill, you owe me one.  This Wedding Fairy Tale is on me.&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Mother's Day and the Parade of the Johns"
  Message: "<p>[First Name], Mother&rsquo;s Day celebrates the efforts of moms to endure discomfort and toil endlessly to nurture the family.  A mom&rsquo;s efforts dwarf those of Hercules.  You want an example?  Keep reading about what happened to Glynnis during the Parade of the Johns.</p>\r\n<p>The Parade of the Johns was Tommy&rsquo;s idea.  It isn&rsquo;t to be confused with the St. John&rsquo;s Parade.  The St. John&rsquo;s Parade is a real serious event: the last years Parade Marshal was Ronald McDonald.  Really.  They got DNA and everything.</p>\r\n<p>Only Tommy, who was a child prodigy as a mafia runner, and now is ethics professor at Waterfront U could come up with this way of celebrating Mother&rsquo;s Day by getting the sexes together.  He cooked it up with the local bars and hookers.</p>\r\n<p>The parade is a way for the hookers and johns to get together.  Kind of a 5 minute speed date.  It started about noon Sunday and ran to closing time.  The johns get a souvenir key-fob and go from bar to bar in St. John&rsquo;s drinking and interviewing their potential &ldquo;milf of the moment.&rdquo;  If everything goes well, johns can get the hooker&rsquo;s key for their fob.</p>\r\n<p>This parade was special, because Rosie, St. John&rsquo;s first gay male hooker, was having his &ldquo;Grand Opening.&rdquo; &nbsp;He wore silver lam&eacute; and lemon pledge perfume.  &mdash; I respect your path, Rosie, but St. John&rsquo;s might be a poor choice for your business plan.  Still, no matter how bizarre someone may be, if they are really fantastically good at what they do, society accommodates them and they set standards for others to follow. Competency offsets deviancy. Time will tell.</p>\r\n<p>The Hope for Health Bar and Urinal was a major stop-over during the parade.  I was there with Southwick, my spiritual bodyguard, sharing a gallon of ultra-light beer.   You know, the one with the slogan: &ldquo;your bladder will bust before your lights go out.&rdquo; (drink responsibly).</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the usual ladies were there, (yes, Throntle, I&rsquo;m going to mention you.  Nicely this time, so don&rsquo;t put salt on my fuchsias again, OK? Please?)  Throntle held her private, VIP only, services in the dumpster out back.  She had made sure that Crandal, the bar&rsquo;s owner had steam-cleaned the dumpster for this event.</p>\r\n<p>What was not expected, was that Glynnis was behind the bar.  The regulars love Glynnis.  She isn&rsquo;t showy, but is one of the sweet ones. She&rsquo;s a working mom with three kids under ten years old.  Good service, accurate, tolerant, and able to go with the flow, and keep the barroom feng-shui going in the right direction.  For some reason, the bar&rsquo;s owner, Crandal, had let the Nobrow, the bouncer, have the day off. Worse yet, Glynnis wasn&rsquo;t tipped off about the johns.</p>\r\n<p>When the owner came in, Glynnis confronted Crandal about the confusion, and was really not happy about all the john&rsquo;s asking for her key.  Crandal and Glynnis had words.</p>\r\n<p>Crandal already had a poor reputation with our locals.  He had run the Lumberjack Sciences Department over at Waterfront U, and had gotten lots of guys to sign up for expensive classes: climbing 101, remedial limb lopping, pitch removal 210, sawing 411, with advanced internships in chopping.  The University got lots of money in student loans, but unfortunately, the lumber industry isn&rsquo;t what it used to be:  It&rsquo;s an old St. John&rsquo;s story.  More workers than jobs &mdash; I think Steinbeck mentioned it once or twice in &ldquo;Grapes of Wrath&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>When Glynnis got back from tapping a new keg in the keg room, she saw Crandal and said: &ldquo;Hey, These guys been hitting on me all day long.   When I got on shift, I got your note saying we needed to promote Tommy&rsquo;s St. John&rsquo;s Parade and I should wear this green ribbon.  I just found out means I&rsquo;m available.  Nobody told me anything about a Parade of the Johns.  And where the hell is Nobrow?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Crandal uses lots of gestures as he talks.  His hands move like snakes. &ldquo;Did Tommy say St. John&rsquo;s Parade?  I thought everybody knew about the Parade of the Johns.  We just came up with it a couple of days ago and sent text messages to everybody.  Maybe you kinda got left out.  Too bad.  Look, I got a place to run, It helps business. Nobrow got sick from eating here last night.  We all hope for his health, until then you just have to deal with it. By the way, change the paper in the ladies room.  Anyway, I gotta hot new key on my fob and I gotta check it out.&rdquo; and he walked away.</p>\r\n<p>Glynnis turned a couple of shades of red, then purple.    She said: &ldquo;This is Mother&rsquo;s Day, and I&rsquo;m a working mom, so I work. But are you insane?&rdquo; She used some words that her mommy never taught her.  Crandal turned back and replied: &ldquo;Watch what you say, you &hellip;&rdquo;  He never finished.  Rosie, whose love for his mom is as extreme as his behavior, started leaping up and down like a salmon, his codpiece gyrating crazily, crying: &ldquo;The Boogy-wumps! The Boogy-wumps!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You mommie hater!&quot; and &quot;Give me my key back!&rdquo; Crandal froze. The locals went wild.</p>\r\n<p>In the confusion, Crandal got sucker punched by one of the locals.   The patrons maintain that Crandal had simply slipped on the floor.  Crandal is in a bad place.  He wants to file charges, but nobody&rsquo;s talking.  He knows he could face a sex harassment suit, he missed his only chance with Rosie, and his &ldquo;Hope for Health Bar and Dumpster&rdquo; lives or dies by the will of the locals.  Judge Rosie gave the verdict and the crowd delivered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw with Glynnis and never, ever on Mother&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I expect his hospital stay to be short but expensive. Glynnis finished her shift with an overflowing tip jar. The Parade of the Johns was a huge success --&nbsp;Tommy says he will schedule the next one on Thanksgiving Day.</p>\r\n<p>By the way, [First Name], what the hell does &ldquo;The Boogy-wumps! The Boogy-wumps!&rdquo; mean?&nbsp;</p>"

  Message: "<p>Recent events have inspired some of us to revel in victory, some to take joy in revenge, some to dig in and say &quot;prove it,&quot; and some to say &quot;A trial is needed.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Kings, presidents, sovereigns, generals, armies and warlords. &nbsp;Which end is up?</p>\r\n<p>Here is a complete fantasy, but one that is entirely technically feasible. &nbsp;It strips out the non-essential elements and simply shows the mechanism of sovereigns. &nbsp;You know, &quot;the buck stops here&quot; kind of stuff. &nbsp;I apologize if it is not as humorous as I usually require.</p>\r\n<p>Voices: &ldquo;We got him! &hellip; &ldquo;Keep him down.&rdquo;  &hellip; &ldquo;Here, just slip this little item on his head.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;Ok.  Guard the exits&hellip; Await my further orders&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The item on his head?<br />\r\nIt looks like a helmet with a bunch of status lights where Darth Vader&rsquo;s mouth would be, and goggles the shape of a thermos bottle over the eyes.  The item filters all the air in and out, has audio and video recording and relay capabilities.  It emits semi-human syllables to the outside to mask the dialog inside the helmet.  It is encrypted and EMF hardened to the highest security specifications, far above the security clearance of any of the men at the scene.</p>\r\n<p>It also has an extra feature&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>The helmet is locked on. &nbsp;It automatically powers up. &nbsp;The status display goes into several boot up stages.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bzzzt.

I will tell you nothing!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You do not have to tell me anything that you do not want to, but as you see in the display in front of you, by the way is it too bright?

Why did you break into my home?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To have this meeting with you, of course.  You have made it inconvenient for us, you know.  Do you recognize the pictures?  I&rsquo;m sure you have seen them many times.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ralf: &ldquo;The pictures fill me with hope that your evil empire will reel under our onslaught of righteousness!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A few moments pass.  There is silence.  A screensaver display appears. &nbsp;It is designed to totally confuse the wearer&rsquo;s sense of balance and location. Ralf tries to stand and falls.  He grabs at the helmet, but can not remove it.  The men who placed it on his head stand back, merely guarding the entrances and exits.  They are not able to hear any of the dialog inside due to the cloaking noises and voices coming out of the helmet.</p>\r\n<p>A few very long moments pass.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Greetings again.  U.S. President here.  I want to thank you for your time.  Your voice matches the acoustic prints we have gathered over the years. Your eyes have tracked our videos, and we have checked your iris markings against our database.  The breath you have exhaled matches DNA we have on file.  In addition, your thumb prints on this gadget&rsquo;s ear handles match our records. &nbsp;Our best intelligence proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are, indeed, Ralf Sighteous. And you are directing a war against a sovereign nation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ralf: &ldquo;Yes!  A war to the last man must be waged!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I respect you as a warrior.  You have been a small, but significant adversary. You have assembled your army and have lead it with your charisma.    However, know this: we have had your compound under electronic surveillance for many months.  Your secrets are secrets no longer.  Your allies have been compromised and your threadbare fantasies are unravelled.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;You are not a king.  You are not a nation.  You are merely a self-proclaimed general of a virtual army, a mere entrepreneurial war-lord, with a fool's mission to subjugate the United States.  Know this:  At this moment, for you, I am the United States. And the helmet you wear is <i>our</i> sovereignty carried to you as you would carry your warfare to us. &nbsp;You know not what game you are really playing.  You have not conquered.  Your charisma is simply a facade behind which your minions will find emptiness.  You are not victorious. The information we have gathered about your values and plans have led us to eliminate your allies. You are defeated in body and soul.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ten thousand miles away, the President enters a code that unlocks a lid covering a button. &nbsp;With due deliberation and finality, he presses it -- &nbsp;electronic packets are sent to the helmet, decoded, matched against unforgeable identity certificates.</p>\r\n<p>A small explosive charge makes photographs of the deceased impossible. &nbsp;The status display flashes a predetermined code to signal the attending team's evacuation.</p>\r\n<p>The men standing by pick up the body and rush to make their exit. &nbsp;The night is almost over.</p>\r\n<p>From the dawn of civilizations we have had warfare. &nbsp;In all cases, a king or general may enforce the subjugation of an army or a nation in the name of his sovereign. &nbsp;It's just what happens. &nbsp;Soveriegns act on their own authority.</p>\r\n<p>With our electronic powers, our sovereign leaders can do the same. &nbsp;Directly, as President Everyman might do. &nbsp;This authority has been given to the president directly by our legal vote and the constitution of the United States. &nbsp;After all, that's what our constitution is all about: &nbsp;Authority, responsibility, delegation and execution.</p>\r\n<p>We all pulled the trigger. &nbsp;May I make my next vote as I remember the awesome power I might give to a lone human. &nbsp;May that person be all we need in our present crisis.</p>"

  Message: "<p>I have run into lean times lately:  until I get my Honorary Ph.D. in Literature from CRUD University and have my best selling novels carry me into economic bliss, I have to deal with limited income and OMG debts.</p>\r\n<p>None of this should be news to anyone (if it is, then pretend you didn&rsquo;t hear it, OK?)</p>\r\n<p>I am dealing with some Mind-watering economic concepts: Every time I try to look at my bank statement, my mind turns to water.  Only the threat of early death due to starvation is forcing me to actually deal with the economic nasty.  Wish me luck.  On the plus side, I am having a bit of good experience with mint.com, but I really don&rsquo;t like all my financials collected in the cloud.  However, the convenience overrides prudence in privacy, and I am seldom prudent.  I&rsquo;m a good american that way &mdash; in the USA we have learned that citizens almost always go for convenience instead of prudence.  Just say&rsquo;n.</p>\r\n<p>I just can&rsquo;t keep track of envelopes, or nearly anything that contains money, but I am finding a way around the &ldquo;put your money in envelopes and hand it out&rdquo; philosophy.  Just buy things one month ahead of time.  For the things I can&rsquo;t buy in quantity, here is how it works: I set up pre-paid accounts with the merchants that I do business with.  I tell them I want to give them a month&rsquo;s worth of money NOW in exchange for services.  The merchants seem to like cash in hand, you know.  They figure out the easiest way to keep track, and all I have to do is keep these accounts topped off once a month.</p>\r\n<p>One of the merchants put up a wild-west poster of me saying &ldquo;PRE-PAID, never carries cash.&rdquo; where &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; would be, with a simple tally sheet for the workers.  I feel like a notorious celebrity.  Every time I go in, I can check up on the status.  I can&rsquo;t spend it somewhere else, and I can&rsquo;t lose it out of my pocket. I don't have to walk around with cash. &nbsp;Pre-payment lowers my risk, and that is valuable to me.</p>\r\n<p>With this kind of budgeting, I can be assured of good food, ale or a book, maybe an occasional mani-pedi.  Pre-payment.  I can only do that with merchants I trust.  Even so, if a merchant goes belly up, my loss is limited.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still a budget.  But it&rsquo;s a lot easier than me keeping track of my money:  Merchants are well set up with the kind of folks who know how to add and subtract, thank goodness.</p>\r\n<p>This seems to work for the merchants here in St. John&rsquo;s.  Value for value.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Now here, I&rsquo;m going to throw in a contrast.   The merchants in Portland rarely have Aloha.  It&rsquo;s more than the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go all out for my customers!&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s like &quot;my customers are mostly family, maybe you, too&quot;.  And in Portland, a merchant with that philosophy might not last too long.  The very few Kings of Pentacles in St. John&rsquo;s who reign with aloha have to keep it hidden, lest it be trod underfoot.</p>\r\n<p>I noticed some of the businesses in HNL really had seemed to open up to the level you only get from functional extended family.  It&rsquo;s the hanai thing.  A common custom in Hawaii is the hanai relative: extended adoption that ignores race lines.  Ohana is not by blood or marriage alone. The guy who wrote &ldquo;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&rdquo; was a hanai kid.  Some of you readers are my ohana,  maybe you all are.</p>\r\n<p>You saw that in everyday transactions between folks. &nbsp;They treat each other as if they were family. It&rsquo;s more than the &ldquo;some of my friends are African-american&rdquo; &mdash; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;some of my family are Chinese, Japanese, Iranian, Jew, and yes, Hawaiian.&rdquo;  The hanai concept of family seems unknown in the mainland.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s aloha, the feeling that you are being treated like family.</p>\r\n<p>To those folks that have shown me great Aloha, I would want to be able to open up an Aloha Account to Post-Pay for all the goodness that you have shown.  You know, pay it backward.  Not soon or much, not on my income, (or demented level of organization), but instead of saving needlessly, I would want to start sending small amounts on a regular schedule.</p>\r\n<p>[First Name], Who has impacted your life in small but consistently beneficial ways whether you were in need or not? One that you don&rsquo;t see often enough anymore, or who you can&rsquo;t repay for all those kindnesses?</p>\r\n<p>Who would you want to set up an Aloha Account for?  Or have you already?</p>"

  Subject: "The Gift of \"Who Are You?\""
  Message: "<p>It all started a few days ago over at the House of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_of_Cups\">Ten of Cups</a>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">That&rsquo;s the good card, you know: It shows a family gazing at their serene home under the arch of rainbow, the parents in warm embrace and the children dancing with joy.  It indicates harmony, quiet accommodation of each other in nurturing ways.  The size of your domain is unimportant, only the rich emotional harvest you may reap.</p>\r\n<p>So let me introduce Mr. and Mrs. Bill and Coo <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.online-mythology.com/baucis_philemon/\">Baucis</a>, who live at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_of_Cups\">#10 Cups Dr</a>.  It&rsquo;s a nice part of the Malibu district of St. John&rsquo;s. And if you look at their yard just right, &ldquo;pillars replace wooden-props,&#8232;and the straw yellowed became golden roofs; &#8232; You see carved doors, and ground covered with marble.&rdquo;  &mdash; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Baucis_and_Philemon_(Wikisource)\">Ovid</a></p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_and_Coo\">Bill</a> herds nuclear plasma by day at Mr. Burn&rsquo;s Radioactive Viagra Factory.  In the off hours, he builds an open air cathedral in the yard with found and recycled items.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_and_Coo\">Coo</a>?  Well, to say that Coo is a gardener is like saying Gandhi was passive-aggressive.  Coo has green hands, and she plays the soil like Bach played the organ.  The organic chords she creates will resonate for years, producing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.patternliteracy.com/permaculture/gaia\">crop after crop</a> in the back-yard cathedral.</p>\r\n<p>Bill has invited me over to see his latest creation: a belfrey for the homeless bats in the neighborhood.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I enter, and the sustainable living channel is playing on the TV in the background:  It&rsquo;s a tinker-survivalist guy who shows lots of McGuyver tricks, like how to boil water with items you can easily find in the crawlspace under a modern house.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I'm not sure that I would survive if my existence was measured in the crawlspace under a modern house. &nbsp;I'd likely find only a concrete slab. &nbsp;Respect to you, Mr. survivalist guy.</p>\r\n<p>Bill talks about bats and says that the enemy of mosquitos is his friend. &nbsp;Bats do good work. &nbsp;We talk about mosquitos, bats, and bees. &nbsp;Bill has bees, too. &nbsp;Coo approves of honey and pollination.</p>\r\n<p>We go outside to look at Bill&rsquo;s bees, whose buzzing hives resembles the nuclear plasmas he attempts to herd at his day-job. Reminding myself of Bill's day job, I keep a watch for three-eyed bees.</p>\r\n<p>Coo talks of the children: &ldquo;With all the stress at school, teen hormones and peer pressure, it seems everyone is putting things onto the kids, but nobody seems interested in who the kid is.  So sometimes I sit with each of my children and ask &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; You know, like:  &lsquo;How would you describe yourself?&rsquo;  &lsquo;Tell me about you.&rsquo;  And I just listen, and just keep letting me tell them about who they think they are.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As she says that I wonder how I would answer that question.  It&rsquo;s pretty deep.  Who do I think I am, anyway? And who cares? &nbsp;After I say good-bye and walk back up the hill to visit our fabled Shanghai Tunnels, I make a resolve to ask someone exactly that question.</p>\r\n<p>As luck would have it, a buddy sits next to me at St. John's Grand Central Tunnels as I enjoy the inconsistancy of the Portland sunshine.  I recap the conversation of Bill and Coo to him and ask: &ldquo;So who are you?  How do you approach your day to day life?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">He looks at me a bit startled.  He wonders if I&rsquo;m really serious.  I assure him that I really am interested in the human experience.  As we talk, we quickly boil away the surface stuff like the price of gas, or the weather, or even who did what to him.  That&rsquo;s external, you know, and it&rsquo;s the internal that is important to each of us.</p>\r\n<p>I keep listening, and only stop him from time to time to get a better understanding of his view of himself.  You know, with questions like:   You use the phrase, &ldquo;fine deal,&rdquo; how do you recognize that?  What has to be present and what has to be lacking for something to be a &ldquo;fine deal?&rdquo;  He talks for at least an hour.  I have to bite my tongue a couple of times to keep from stopping his flow with my &ldquo;suggestions.&rdquo; &nbsp;Which indicate &quot;who I want you to be&quot; and is exactly the opposite of &quot;who are you?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to leave, and as I get up, he says: &ldquo;Thanks, I feel like I know myself better, and I know what I need to do next.&rdquo;  I guess it&rsquo;s a powerful thing to know yourself better.  What a gift to give to a person: It doesn&rsquo;t cost me a thing to listen, and, I might get a Pabst or two.  It sure beats watching Jeopardy re-runs.</p>\r\n<p>So I walk back down to my palatial estate, and see Bill and Coo quietly multiplexing the duties of builder, gardener, mommy, daddy, companion, provider, nuturer, recycler and sustainer.  They wave and say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; &mdash; I relate my little experience with my buddy a few minutes earlier.</p>\r\n<p>Bill says: &ldquo;Yeah, it can work that way.  We do it together, you know.&rdquo;<br />\r\nCoo says: &ldquo;Bill has always given me an open ear.&rdquo;<br />\r\nBill looks into Coos eyes: &ldquo;And you have always given me an open heart.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Coo gives Bill the perfect kiss.  A choir of Dwane Eddie Guitars breaks out in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGPG_Y-_BZI\">&ldquo;Rebel Rouser&rdquo;</a> (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGPG_Y-_BZI) and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_of_Cups\">kids dance as the sun breaks through the stained glass windows of the great trees of Baltimore Wood</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Bouncy Boom Gets Her Skates"
  Message: "<p>Every great industry has a folk hero: Paul Bunyan, John Henry, Pecos Bill all represent mainstream working class archetypes.  All men. &nbsp;Roller Derby is bigger than all of those old industries: Logging, Railroading or Cattle. &nbsp;Roller Derby is too much for mere men. &nbsp;Only the finest amazons allowed, you know.</p>\r\n<p>In the inner most circle of Roller Derby, the tales of Bouncy Boom are the biggest and wildest.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you have heard some of the stories, or seen the pictures: a willowy skater who inherited her mom&rsquo;s distinctive skating ability and combined it with legs powerful enough to flip over an 18 wheeler.  She could slither into the tightest formations and explode the opposing team members like bowling pins into the stands.  Using her five foot braids like whips, she could boost a team mate into overdrive through the other team.</p>\r\n<p>Her early years are shrouded in secrecy since the mob was on the rampage from her birth. Bouncy Boom and her mom went into hiding for 18 years.  Some say that Bouncy Boom made a brief career as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://observers.france24.com/content/20100405-bolivia-cholitas-female-wrestlers-plaits-petticoats\">Cholita</a>, a South American female wrestler when she was 12.  She won too many matches, and the authorities stepped in.  &ldquo;Too young to wrestle,&rdquo; they said and she quickly disappeared again.</p>\r\n<p>But this is about Bouncy Boom&rsquo;s birth, and it is well worth telling and retelling.  Here is the story as I heard it from the muse:</p>\r\n<p>Bouncy Boom&rsquo;s mom was an old-school Roller Derby gal in the &rsquo;50s: A full figured polynesian who skated under the name Wahina Kapu for the Richter Tens.  They chanted &ldquo;These quakes will move your earth!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Killer quakes coming up fast,&rdquo; during the meets.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Kapu was a fabulous blocker, with her roller skate powered hula hips.   She always taunted the other players saying &ldquo;Betta watch hands, no hips, ya?&rdquo;  It seldom mattered if the other players watched her hands or hips, because very few got by them. &nbsp;The fans always watched the hips.</p>\r\n<p>One evening, huge money was riding on a prestige bet between Leo and Cho: two mob king-pins. &nbsp;They had argued for years about the black market in ten-finger poi.  During the heat of the last jam, Cho was taunted into putting up a portion of his territory.  Leo had arranged for one of the Richter Tens to get ejected at just that moment, making the team one player short.  Cho was in deep trouble and smelled a rat.</p>\r\n<p>The jam was lopsided:&nbsp;Wahina Kapu was struggling with the other team&rsquo;s onslaught and just as Wahina got a major bump, she cried &ldquo;&lsquo;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Hawaiian/auwe\">Auwe</a>!&rdquo; and gave birth.  Bouncy Boom just tumbled out, and the opposing jammer wiped out.</p>\r\n<p>Wahina Kapu, who up to this point had barely noticed her pregnancy, skated a victory lap around the track, laughed and scooped up the baby, saying &ldquo;You go Bouncy Boom!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Within days, Bouncy Boom and mom had to go into hiding to avoid Leo&rsquo;s revenge because the judges, who were in Cho&rsquo;s pocket, and careful to please the crowd, were &ldquo;persuaded&rdquo; to declare Bouncy Boom an officially substituted member of the team and give her skates at birth.</p>\r\n<p>Leo swore revenge, but Bouncy Boom was born to skate. &nbsp;The rest, they say, is Mythology.</p>"

  Subject: "Squirrel Tag"
  Message: "<p>This year is the year of the rodent. &nbsp;The squirrel, that is. &nbsp;We got more squirrels than working cars in St. John's. &nbsp;As rodents go, they got at least one thing going for 'em -- the tail.</p>\r\n<p>I have been envious of the squirrels&rsquo; tails.  Big, fluffy.  Fits with my PNW color scheme.  A fashion statement.  Crazy PNW guy should have crazy sustainable local fur.</p>\r\n<p>The trouble is, I can only claim the prize if I fight the squirrel in mano-a-mano combat.  No rules, save good respect for a noble enemy.  I will get your tail.  Know that, sucka!</p>\r\n<p>We have so many squirrels that the neighborhood hawks have installed a &ldquo;take-a-number&rdquo; system to maintain sustainability.  I am human so I bump myself to the front of the line: fuck your accountant&rsquo;s rules, Mr. Hawk!</p>\r\n<p>As for the squirrel, I plan on appealing to the little bozo&rsquo;s greed.  Maybe training the squirrel to find a choice morsel in a certain place at a certain time, then waiting with a baseball bat behind a squirrel-blind.  That seems like a good strategy.  Me. The squirrel.  The prize. And the stick.  I think Clint Eastwood might approve, except Clint would have me lose the squirrel-blind and hide behind a manly smile.</p>\r\n<p>Clint, you got me there.  Hiding behind a blind isn&rsquo;t manly, but it is sustainable.  As I ponder the spiritual implications, the TV cuts in with an infomercial:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you plagued by squirrels??  Play Squirrel Tag!  Shortly, we will be outfitting all the squirrels&rsquo; in your district with non-removable solar powered laser tag suits.  A direct hit will scare the bejesus out of the little mofo.  He won&rsquo;t be around YOUR yard anytime soon.</p>\r\n<p>The Squirrel Tag package is only $85 with a monthly fee of 9.95.  Imagine a whole year of fun training your squirrels in a humane, sustainable way.  We install, maintain and recycle the squirrel suits using our GPS technology.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m entranced.  But what about the tail?  I call the 800 number: A voice says: &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Bob, we are very, very fine here, how are you, sir? May I call you Mr. 503-453-9999?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I answer: &ldquo;Um, my name is Jim, but what about the squirrels?  Do I get the tail?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The voice responds: &ldquo;Oh, my yes, Mr. Jim 453- 9999, we have squirrel&hellip;   Yes, squirrel&hellip;  Yes, here it is, squirrel tag.  Are you ready to tell us your Visa Number? or would you like to know about how you can profit from the squirrel explosion in (mechanical voice cuts in) Malibu District, St. John&rsquo;s, Portland, Oregon 97203,USA. (Bob&rsquo;s voice cuts back in) is that right Mr. Jim 9999?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I respond a bit sheepishly from Bob&rsquo;s knowing so much about where I live.  &ldquo;Um. I&rsquo;m interested in squirrel tails?  Do I get to keep the tail?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The voice on the other side sputters a bit.  Bob is a bit uncomfortable with my question: &ldquo;Oh, no, sir, our package is totally sustainable.  We do not hurt squirrels.  It is against ahimsa.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m pushing a bit: &ldquo;But you said I could Zap the little mofo&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bob replied: &ldquo;Our suits deliver micro-shocks to the Solar Epidermal Layer of the Lower Plexus.  It is totally safe, and I have done it many times.  And let me tell you, I would not be never be stealing any nuts from anyone soon.  Oh, my, yes.  You won&rsquo;t believe it until you have tried it, sir: totally safe it is, yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m flashing on his statement: &ldquo;I have done it many times&hellip;,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe it till I&rsquo;ve tried it?&rdquo;   Is he reading this from some prepared spiel?</p>\r\n<p>I am a bit flustered: &ldquo;No, I want to catch the little buggers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bob&rsquo;s voice brightens up noticeably on the other side.  &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Sir Jim 9999!  My very best friend!  Have you not heard about our most excellent &ldquo;local service provider&rdquo; network?  I can have you set as our (mechanical voice cuts in) Malibu District, St. John&rsquo;s, Portland, Oregon 97203 USA (Bob&rsquo;s voice cuts back in) local service provider!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m interested: &ldquo;What do I do?  What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bob says: &ldquo;We supply you with squirrel suits which you will put on each squirrel.  You will receive many cents each time a squirrel is hit with a laser.  How many squirrel suits would you like?  100?  500?  Many of our local representatives  would wish they had 10,000 suits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m slightly interested: &ldquo;Is it easy to put the suit on?  Put the suit on the squirrel, that is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bob says:  &ldquo;We have a tutorial DVD that explains everything.  After you pay for your first 100 suits, we will send it out to you for only shipping charges and handling expansions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>My suspicions are aroused: &ldquo;100 suits?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bob replies: &ldquo;Oh, thank goodness! you want 100 suits!  Your suits will arrive by feral express by next thursday.  Your account has already been charged, but that is such good news for you, Sir Mr. Jim.  At almost some cents per zap you can be making profit from abundant squirrel meets you will organize in (mechanical voice cuts in) surrounding area of Malibu District, St. john&rsquo;s, Portland, Oregon 97203 USA. (Bob&rsquo;s voice cuts in again) Isn&rsquo;t that right Mr. Jim Sir? 97203? Or yes?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I stammer: &ldquo;Um. 97203. Um. Yes. Um&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Bob replies: &ldquo;Thank you for your order. Make sure you keep the tails in good condition: nobody wants to shoot a squirrel that has no tail. ThankYou,CallAgain.&rdquo; &mdash; click</p>\r\n<p>What the hell am I going to do with 100 zapable squirrel suits?  And how am I supposed to put them on?  And what about the DVD?  Jeez, I hope it isn&rsquo;t another of those crappy tutorials that make you watch until the last 10 seconds for the answer you need.</p>\r\n<p>And the worst part is that I can&rsquo;t keep the mofo tails.</p>\r\n<p>What should I do????  I would ask Clint Eastwood, but in the time it took me to write this, he caught two squirrels in his teeth, had them skinned, seasoned, stewed and tanned.</p>\r\n<p>He throws their tails at my feet and then he walks off into the sunset.&nbsp;</p>"

  Subject: "Coala: Harbor Cat"
  Message: "<p>I had two cats, Cobbee and Coala, when I lived on my boat in Santa Barbara Harbor.</p>\r\n<p>Jim: Southwick, here's your assignment. Make a voyage to the akashic bar and grill, where all the fogged memories of mankind are stored, and get Coala&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: &nbsp;Woo, Woo, Woo, Bookoo Snafoo. &nbsp;Akashic records now I view.</p>\r\n<p>Jim: That's just freaking corny. &nbsp;Are you sure that's how to channel a cat?</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Take a back seat, buddy. Let me work here. &nbsp; -- Coala, Coala, make yourself known-la.</p>\r\n<p>Jim: &quot;known-la?&quot; -- give me a break.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Butt out. Shhh.</p>\r\n<p>A voice: Miaw?</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Hey, Coala!  Miaw!  Come, sit wit me.  I&rsquo;m a friend of Jim, your old chum.  Lemme know wassup?</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Jim? Yeah, he was OK. Chum? &nbsp;I love chum. &nbsp;It's fish scraps. &nbsp;You gonna pick up the tab?</p>\r\n<p>Southwick:  You know me,  I&rsquo;m good for it, as long as there&rsquo;s a good story in it.  Hey! Bartender! Gimme a high colonic with a chaser of holy water, and what ever my friend here wants.</p>\r\n<p>Coala: water and fish offal. It&rsquo;s my favorite!  You know I never got that since I moved from the Harbor.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Fish offal? um. Er.... (silence.) Anyway, how&rsquo;d that harbor life work out for you?  Anything fun happen there?</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Yeah, sure!  I got to sit in the Santa Barbara sun in the afternoons.  Cobbee and I shared the boat with Jim. Cobbee and I would pry open his crock-pot and scatter his dinner around the boat when he was gone. &nbsp;We were careful, though, he knew all these human tricks.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Tricks?</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Yeah, magic stuff, like how to lock doors and move his fingers and shit.  Make real deamons!  He could turn dead snakes into deamons.  Make food appear by magic.  Human stuff.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: I got the moving fingers thing, but what about the snakes?</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  Snakes hate cats.  They are evil kitten killers, and we got to put the big fear into &lsquo;em.  It&rsquo;s fun, too.  Jim could make dead snakes come alive with his demon magic.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: You mean like when Jim would shake a some rope for you to play with?</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  Rope?  Yeah.  And boat-lines and yarn snakes too.  Lots of &lsquo;em in the harbor.  They would be dead.  Dead, dead.  And Jim would pick one up and POW!  It lives!  I would kill it every time!</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: You really know how to have fun.</p>\r\n<p>Coala: You said it buddy!  I hung out on the dock most afternoons.  I&rsquo;d sleep, or watch the other boats for signs that their dead snake boat-lines would turn into deamons.  I would watch the birds.   I would keep the gulls off track as I looked for fish heads on the docks.  That kind of thing.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick:  What was the craziest thing that happened there?</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Well, sometimes Jim would set sail.  That was usually not fun.  Cobbee hated it and got real cat-sick to show how much he hated it. &nbsp;Jim lost lots of shirts to Cobbee's puke. &nbsp;Me? I had survived all the sea deamons, so I knew it would be all right.</p>\r\n<p>Southiwick: Sea demons? &nbsp;What were the sea demons like?</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Yeah, ALL of the Sea Demons.  I&rsquo;m a survivor.</p>\r\n<p>Here's how it went down:&nbsp;Jim often let me wander in the afternoons, and sometimes he left the hatch open at night. I&rsquo;d jump on deck.  There were never any seagulls out at night, so I went to all the boats I could.</p>\r\n<p>There was one boat that had a whole bag of chopped frozen fish on the deck.  I couldn&rsquo;t resist, and jumped up to get my share before the sun came up.</p>\r\n<p>Just then, three big humans walked right ON the boat!  Oh, shit. Untrained humans.  You never know what they might do.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to train as many humans as possible.  I had never trained any of these guys, so I ran to hide in a little box in the cockpit. &nbsp;I was safe. &nbsp;Or so I thought.</p>\r\n<p>I waited for them to go, but instead, they woke up a growling evil demon inside the boat that wanted to eat me. The boat rocked back and forth like an earthquake.  I hid.  I thought I was going to die.  Shit.  Humans.  Fucking magic.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick:  Yeah, The engine, I guess, that must have been scary.</p>\r\n<p>Coala: You said it, bub.  Hey, when&rsquo;s my order going to be ready?  I want my meal.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Um. It&rsquo;s coming, here, have this instead.</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  Wow. A piece of soy with the flavor of chicken heart. &nbsp;Is that all you got?</p>\r\n<p>Southwick:  (squirm), Um. soon, soon. &nbsp;So what happened on the boat?  After they started the engines?</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  Well, it must have been about an hour, and then they killed the engine demon.   But the earthquake was worse.  I was just getting sick, when one of the guys open up my hiding place and stuck his hand in!  His magic human hand!</p>\r\n<p>I tell you, I let out a shriek and jumped right out!  I sailed through the air from the cockpit to the deck.  There were two humans their with huge sticks in their arms!</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: &ldquo;You mean fishing poles?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Coala: No, sucka!  They were sticks with snakes that had nasty teeth!</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: &ldquo;You mean fishing line and hooks?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Hey, don&rsquo;t interrupt me.  I&rsquo;m just getting to the scary part.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: MORE scary?</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  So I land on the deck and these guys are freaking out.  Anything is better than being sick on a boat with the engine demon wanting to eat me and being surrounded by magic humans with snakes with teeth. So I jump back on to the dock.</p>\r\n<p>Would you believe it?  These humans had made the dock disappear!  They made the whole freaking harbor disappear.  All there was was water everywhere.  And I was in it!  Talk about a demon.  Water is the worst.  You can kill a snake, but you can&rsquo;t kill water.</p>\r\n<p>I fought hard to keep the water deamon from swallowing me.  I don&rsquo;t know how long I fought and I was nearly ready to give up, and a miracle happened!  I was lifted out of the water by magic snakes!  The humans had trained these snakes to hold hands somehow. I was put back on the deck. Wet.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: Holy, Holy, Hosannahs! By the eyes of the Saints! A Miracle!</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  Yeah, They called it a fishnet, but it wasn&rsquo;t made of fish.  Stupid name.  They should call it snake nest, if you ask me.  I hate snakes.  Do you know how humiliating it is to be saved by skinny snakes? &nbsp;And I'm all WET?! That's really insulting. That's the kind of magic that freaks me out. &nbsp;Jeez, humans.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, I ran down to the lowest part of the boat.  It was the farthest from the water that I could get.  And nowhere the humans could go.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick:  What happened then?</p>\r\n<p>Coala: I waited. After a while, the humans started the engine demon again. &nbsp;I kept hiding and waited till afternoon.  The humans stopped the engine, turned off the earthquake and left the boat.  I waited till evening.  It was quiet.  Someone came a couple of times and pretended to be mama.  It could be Jim, but I didn&rsquo;t trust any human. After all, where was <i>HE</i> when the dock disappeared!</p>\r\n<p>When the moon was up, and I could see that it was really him, I came out and he took me home. &nbsp;The ordeal was over. &nbsp;I survived.</p>\r\n<p>And he had dinner ready too. &nbsp;So, Southwick buddy, what about my fish?  Are you gonna pay up?</p>\r\n<p>Southwick:  Well, Er. Um.</p>\r\n<p>Coala: Hey!  What are you?  An akashic cosmic welcher?  You said I get fish offal! &nbsp;Watch out or I'll pee on your underwear.</p>\r\n<p>Jim: Holy cat piss! Southwick!  Mandatory meeting!  Give Coala what he wants!  It&rsquo;s a good story.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick: What are you doing in this seance? And, <i>pu-leeze</i>, entrails? My Jagged Guru would NOT approve.</p>\r\n<p>Jim: Southwick, don't pull any &quot;holier than thou&quot; crap when you read the Akashic Records. &nbsp;I want my underwear without cat pee on 'em.</p>\r\n<p>-- Hey, Coala, good buddy, you remember me?  Miaw, Purr, Purr. Here is your fish: you know fish offal isn&rsquo;t good for you: it causes you to break out in bumps.  Purr. Next time let&rsquo;s stick to real cat food, OK?</p>\r\n<p>Coala:  Thanks Jim.  You&rsquo;re OK too, but your food is pretty boring.</p>\r\n<p>Jim:  Ciao and Miaw for now, Coala, thanks for the story. &nbsp;You can feast all you want here at the Akashic Bar and Grill. &nbsp;It's always afternoon in Santa Barbara for you my good cat. &nbsp;Plenty of fish for you. &nbsp;It's all on my tab: after all, I'm the author.</p>\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s what harbor life was like for a cat in Santa Barbara, CA.  As far as Southwick, I&rsquo;ve asked him to teach ALL of my characters how to channel. &nbsp;My underwear can&rsquo;t afford to be at the mercy of Southwick&rsquo;s Jagged Guru.  How come there are no smooth gurus?</p>"

  Subject: "Shanghai Tunnel Tales - Part 1"
  Message: "<p>They have tried to suppress the rumors for a very long time.  Every time I ask about the Shanghai Tunnels under the James John Cafe, the owners kind of put their eyes skyward and say they don&rsquo;t know anything about it.  In fact, nobody in St. John&rsquo;s is talking.  Obviously a conspiracy to hide the truth.</p>\r\n<p>The only person that even had a clue was Tommy, the Dean of Damaged Cargo at Waterfront U,  when he said: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find anything above the water line.&rdquo;  I immediately had Winnie Daough give me SCUBA training.  She didn&rsquo;t know anything about SCUBA but that&rsquo;s never stopped her from doing anything, and that&rsquo;s good enough for me.  She taught me all about pressure, tanks, and procedures.  Everything from scaring sharks with underwater loogies to how to make a tourniquet out of seaweed and barnacles.</p>\r\n<p>I suited up, filled my tanks at the Seven Eleven&rsquo;s gas station using an adapter flange that Winnie had cobbled together with duct tape, and went down to the Willamette River.   I decided that I should comb the St. John&rsquo;s side of the river just downstream of the bridge.  I blocked it out in geometrical precision and did a careful search.  On the third night, I found it!</p>\r\n<p>Using my cell phone to light the way, I swam into the mouth of what looked like a very large drain pipe.  Once inside, I climbed up a rotting ladder to a small room.  The wall read &ldquo;&mdash;&gt; Shanghai,&rdquo; and &ldquo;&lt;&mdash; St. John&rsquo;s.&rdquo;  Total proof.</p>\r\n<p>The floor was dry and so I went uphill following the arrows to St. John&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Soon, the noises in the tunnel made it clear that I was passing under train tracks.  As I went higher, the walls vibrated in that unmistakable slap-chunk-slap-slap-bonk of Winnie&rsquo;s washer-dryer in the spin cycle. &nbsp; I knew I was on the right track.</p>\r\n<p>Somewhat farther on, the rumble of heavy trucking rigs indicated that I was under Ivanhoe, and was nearing Lombard.  At one of the many side branches along the way, I saw what looked like it had been a door.  I snaked a bit closer, and found a mound of rubble blocking it.</p>\r\n<p>I scraped away enough to see the writing: &ldquo;Dispatch.&rdquo;  I cleared away more and pushed my way through to a room with ten narrow benches laid out like fingers and the remains of a teller cage with another door behind it.  There were even times of departure for ships and a tally board to indicate how many kidnapees were required and amounts paid for each. &mdash; I had hit on something big.  An underground holding room!</p>\r\n<p>I opened an old log book in the corner.  It seemed to belong to someone who only signed himself as &ldquo;JJ&rdquo; I saw entries with names, dates, and money received. &nbsp;In old style flowery script, It was detailed in things like distinguishing marks, tattoos, body build, weight and such. It was clear from the layout that the &ldquo;sailor trainees&rdquo; were laid out on the benches as they were delivered from the bawdy houses above.  The money transactions between thugs and sea captains were done here.</p>\r\n<p>All businesslike:  Like maybe this &mdash;</p>\r\n<p>Jake the thug: Here&rsquo;s a good one.  Listen to him. He doesn&rsquo;t wheeze.  His muscles are toned, yeah, and there&rsquo;s no scurvy on his gums.  I say he&rsquo;s worth $5.</p>\r\n<p>Captain Bilgewater: Let me see.  He smells familiar. Turn him over.  Just as I thought!  He is already signed onto my ship!  I&rsquo;ll not pay twice for my own crew member, you blackguard! I&rsquo;d as soon take you on my ship and teach you not to trick me!</p>\r\n<p>JJ:  Come, come, gentlemen, we should not argue about such things.  The good captain is right.  Let&rsquo;s come to a suitable agreement.  Captain, I&rsquo;m sure that we can deliver this man to your ship immediately.  As you see, he is in no shape to make your sailing time in his current condition.  I propose that we simply take your man to your ship, and we simply put it down as a one dollar delivery charge, which you can just take out of his pay in the next port.  Bilgewater?  Jake?</p>\r\n<p>Bilgewater: Fifty cents, Saint! And not a penny more!</p>\r\n<p>Jake: But that means I only get twenty five!</p>\r\n<p>JJ: Take or leave it, Jake.  You should be more careful about your &ldquo;hiring interviews.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Jake: (grumble): Done!</p>\r\n<p>JJ: Yes, Captain a fair offer: you will find your man fit and on his feet well before you may need him when you hit the bar at the mouth of the Columbie. Fifty cents, please.  Thank you.  Sign here, Thank you.  Jake, sign here, and take this release with you.  Have the good Captain Bilgewater sign it, and bring it back to me for your twenty five cents.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, it all seems very businesslike. &nbsp;The log book had many such entries.</p>\r\n<p>I dug further.  My hands trembled with excitement as I found other books heaped on the floor. Most were handwritten, each page written in the same old flowery script.  There was a diary and a book of recipes with &ldquo;Lena&rsquo;s 1001 feasts&rdquo; in calligraphy on the title page.</p>\r\n<p>I grabbed the diary along with a couple of other books on the floor, stuffed them inside my wet suit and went back to the main tunnel.  Following the air flow another few feet I found a crude rebar ladder running up the side.  I climbed up. It was hard considering I was still wearing my flippers and air-tank. &nbsp;I got to the top just as the battery in my cell phone gave out and my light died.</p>\r\n<p>I pushed open the man-hole cover at the top of the ladder and came out at a secret location &mdash; the town square.  It was farmers market day, so I blended right in with the other people.  A person in a wet-suit, air tank and flippers is not a big deal compared to the other styles of St. John&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p>I crossed over to the James John Cafe, and wrote this until the air in my tank ran out.</p>"

  Subject: "Leo and Station's healing"
  Message: "<p>June 12, 2099. St John's. &nbsp;Portland, Oregon. &nbsp;Where the Columbia and the Willamette and the Summer and Spring come together. &nbsp;And get restraining orders.</p>\r\n<p>The San Francisco morning will soon change into a Death Valley afternoon by way of the Donner party's Winter all join together here in St. John&rsquo;s. Perfectly normal. &nbsp;SSDD. Same Shit, Different Day.</p>\r\n<p>What IS different, is that I have not been really free to talk about Leo and Station for quite some while. &nbsp;Leo is the defrocked pope of the internet and Station is his estranged Pacific Island companion.</p>\r\n<p>Everybody seems to know them, and I don't want to let any private lives creep into my fiction. &nbsp;After all, it is fiction. &nbsp;But the wisdom of fiction overrides mere facts, sometimes. &nbsp;That's why fiction has never been outlawed. &nbsp;Maybe.</p>\r\n<p>-- Today, Leo and Station are in the back yard with Pathy Daough.  Pathy is pointing to the remains of a seed pod.  &ldquo;And it even ate my habanero!  I think it's a slug!  Uggh.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Station says: &ldquo;In my culture, anything that can transmute the habanero is highly prized. We call it <i>Mana-Bo-Banana-Fana-Mana</i>.  It is very rare to hold and concentrate the habanero energy. Imagine the Chi-overflow protection system.  It must hold the plant-energy of the habanero so that it can be released in chakras of amazing Baboo!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo looks at Station and says: &ldquo;Baboo?  Like we used to have?&rdquo;  Station looks at Leo and their eyes soften a bit.  In a flash, Station is combing the underleaves like his tropic ancestors.</p>\r\n<p>Pathy looks startled as Station holds out his prize to her.  He says: &ldquo;Pathy, here it is.&rdquo;  It starts oozing up his wrist.</p>\r\n<p>Pathy look at it with disgust, &ldquo;Slugs, ugh, get rid of it.&rdquo; Leo shoots a glance to Station and flares his nostrils like Kirk Douglas in a '50s flick. Station shoots a look back like Victor Mature and becomes kittenish. &nbsp;They lock hands and walk up the path to their house: &quot;Thank you, Pathy: You have no idea the gift you have found.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Leo and Station are suddenly very chatty as they quickly walk back to their home. Halfway there, Leo slid the thing off of Station&rsquo;s shoulder onto his hand. They disappear into their house.</p>\r\n<p>A few hours later, Leo and Station are talking.  This is such a relief , compared to the odd distanced looks they had been exchanging for the last few months.  Evidently Leo&rsquo;s fall from the high wire of internet espionage had been devastating to both of them.</p>\r\n<p>This very afternoon, Leo sets up a meeting with Pathy and her sister, Winnie. &nbsp;It seems that after an incredible sexual healing session, Leo and Station decided they had hit a gold mine.  They even contacted the Bogo-Exhaulted Shaw-Himani of The Colony-Rapee of Qumquat and found that Pathy had the real goods.</p>\r\n<p>Leo called a meeting and all are huddled around Pathy&rsquo;s table sipping Magic Monkey tea: &ldquo;So Station and I can breed these things in our basement, and Pathy, you grow as many peppers that you can.  Winnie, you set up the production line, OK?  We feed the nasties with Pathy&rsquo;s peppers, harvest, freeze dry using Winnie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cold Shoulder&rdquo; method, then pulverize them using Station's silat martial arts.  We figure that an ounce will be worth $10,000.00 for the geriatric set.  We can say it puts the boom back into the boomer generation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Everyone around the table cracks up. &nbsp;And so a new health care market opens, drawing all the usual suspects.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, Leo and Station&rsquo;s have found a profitable business on Cragslisp with their new Web Video Sex Wrestling Seminars:</p>\r\n<p>Partners are only asked one question: &ldquo;Will you let your partner, at this time, give you the ultimate pleasure of the body &mdash; the detachment and beyond?&rdquo;  As they affirm, they are admitted to the seminar.</p>\r\n<p>Here are the guidelines for level 1 certification, Marquis of Celarien Rules &mdash; <br />\r\nThe goal of level 1 is to be able to get the partner to &ldquo;detachment&rdquo; which is identified as to have uncontrollable breathing, moans, and shouts of &ldquo;Yes, yes, God YeS!&rdquo; &mdash; Some Marines have been known to shout &ldquo;More P.T. Sargent!&rdquo; at this moment.  Please calibrate for your partner.</p>\r\n<p>Sex-wrestling Guidelines.<br />\r\n0) Safety in all aspects.<br />\r\n1) Safe words are simple, easily pronounceable and totally honored. <br />\r\n2) no genital-oral contact of more than .5 second, breast and anus included for the first 3 rounds.<br />\r\n3) only one knuckle insertion allowed during the first four rounds.<br />\r\n4) When a partner is able to get the other aroused to the point of detachment, a point is scored.</p>\r\n<p>On a flip of the coin, one side is designated &ldquo;inside&rdquo; and has hands free to access all the secret places of the outside partner&rsquo;s body.  The outside is free to access a more limited range but may block or deflect or direct the inside partner to extend or direct the play as desired. The inside&rsquo;s goal is to get the partner to detachment, and the roles are reversed.</p>\r\n<p>At any time, the outside may call &ldquo;School&rdquo; and the outside has thirty seconds to &ldquo;Take You To School&mdash; and show exactly how good boys or girls can learn how to please.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ratings are for number of role reversals before passion tears the rules to shreds.  Young couples in excellent health can do 4 turn arounds in a minute.  At the end of the heat, In professional tournament play, the couple is then sprayed with CO2 from an extinguisher.  In private play, let your conscience be your guide.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash; Hey, kids,  don&rsquo;t hold me responsible for any  mollusca-banero snacks you come across!  It is all Leo&rsquo;s and Station&rsquo;s idea. &nbsp;If it's slimey, it belongs to The Grouch.</p>"

  Subject: "Apollo's Virgin"
  Message: "<p>My friend Southwick says he channeled it from the Akashic Records -- I think it has a message for our times in here somewhere:</p>\n<p>[First Name], I am Amenea, I am the seer of the Temple of Apollo in a town three days ride from Thebes.  I have devoted my existence to  Apollo since my parents were cursed.  They had sickness and poverty and cruel masters.</p>\n<p>With my sacrifice to the temple, Apollo gave them release: Afterwards, they flourished as traders, surely that is the mark of the approval of Apollo.  They have been steadfast in their offerings to my temple.</p>\n<p>I had been a temple virgin for many years.  I thank Apollo for restoring my innocence 1000 times and more.  Apollo requires great sacrifice on the part of the adherents, you know.  That is proper.  Apollo has seen fit to allow me to open my womb to four new souls, although only two survive.  These grace-filled two are steadfast in their observation of Apollo’s rules.  They are both carrying on Apollo’s work in the land beyond the highest mountains of Persia.</p>\n<p>For you, [First Name], my trusted friend, you need to know this --</p>\n<p>I have been the high priestess here for the last 15 years.  I have earned my position only by the total surrender to Apollo.  For the first time 200 years, this temple has a high priestess that has given sight to Apollo.  Yes, I have given my sight to Apollo.  I have gazed into our sun.  Repeatedly.  I wanted to behold Apollo, and Apollo has shown me the world beyond the world.  My worldly eyes are freely given to you, Apollo, for the gift of truly knowing who you are.</p>\n<p>The hours of pain and the days of darkness have only allowed me to see more clearly:  I have received the answer to many of the questions that prevented me from allowing the true nature of reality to be known.  I would want you, [First Name], to know that before we proceed.</p>\n<p>I have not done this under duress.  I freely give myself to the greater good that Apollo has offered me in return.</p>\n<p>I am writing you at Apollo's great strength, in June, when the rays are most potent with this most potent opportunity: One of Apollo’s supporters with your same surname has died recently in our temple and his entire holdings are, at this moment: 3500 goats, 5300 cattle, 15,000 cubits of grain and 1450 hectares of fertile river bottom land, which only 350 hectares is ever flooded.</p>\n<p>Alas, his entire estate is waiting for someone to claim it.  I appeal to you as someone with the same surname to allow the wisdom of Apollo to fill your days and lives to come forward and claim your prize.</p>\n<p>Since I am sightless, I would wish you to declare your intentions to carry through the good work of our righteousness and strength: Apollo.</p>\n<p>Please reply by sending your replies to htttp://I am so gullible.com/</p>\n<p>Strength and Light given to you my friend in bliss.</p>\n<p>Amenea</p>"

  Subject: "Too Young?"
  Message: "<p>I saw a performance by a Jackie Evancho, a truly gifted child with a fabulous voice.  It is the kind of voice that inspires any well-connected agent to call God directly and schedule her try-out for the voice that announces the Second Coming of Christ.  In song, she carries the Gravitas of Morgan Freeman, The World-Wise qualities of Nelson Mandela and the resonance of Kate Smith.  She is equally at ease in duets with Barbra Streisand or Susan Boyle.</p>\r\n<p>Like I said, fabulous.  But with an odd hitch.  Watching her sing weirded me out.  Not just me, a couple of other people mentioned the same thing.  Why should excellence be weird?</p>\r\n<p>My guess is that it had to do with her child like nature.  A kid is not supposed to know all about the emotional depths of intense life and death romantic love that is needed to understand Bernstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Place for Us.&rdquo;  But this kid conveyed that emotion perfectly.</p>\r\n<p>Close your eyes, you would swear that this soul had swam in hormone hurricane churned seas &mdash; slammed against the sad rocks of society&rsquo;s expectations &mdash; and finally accepts the doom of Romeo and Juliet.</p>\r\n<p>Open your eyes, and you see a body that should be singing &ldquo;I love Barney,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sharing is Fun.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>In the same way that &ldquo;Little Miss Sunshine&rdquo; pointed out the creepy nature of Pre-pubescent Beauty Queens, this young lady has poked a similar button.  But she has done nothing wrong, and is just expressing her gifts as a performer and a human being.  Like &ldquo;Little Miss Sunshine&rdquo; herself &mdash; simply a little girl with a dream and some inspired coaching, she is reaching for a goal that inspires her.  The abreaction is mine alone, It is me.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s MY expectation of human development that gets punched in the nose by the &ldquo;fist of perhaps.&rdquo;  &mdash; either children have a greater emotional capacity than I know, or that she is simply a capable performer who can &ldquo;fake&rdquo; the emotions with expert ease.  An actor does that for breakfast, lunch and dinner, why not a little girl?  After all, it&rsquo;s just a performance.</p>\r\n<p>Obviously, the answer is both.</p>\r\n<p>But if she sings The Kink&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lola&rdquo; with equal passion,  I am running for cover!  Lord save us all.</p>"

  Subject: "Pathy Has the Best Gossip"
  Message: "<p>[First Name], You have no idea how hard it is to write: &ldquo;right mood&rdquo; (check); &ldquo;flowing emotional ideas&rdquo; (check); time (check, check and megacheck); battery life (check); good ambient feng-shui (che&mdash; Um. what the hell is ambient feng-shui???)</p>\r\n<p>Well, I can tell you what it is NOT. &nbsp;Like today, when the U.S. Open golf tournament is on full babble. Seemingly everywhere, even from the cars that drive by.  It&rsquo;s like the P.A. announcements on M.A.S.H.  Winnie Daough herself has gone from daydreaming in a bean bag chair to high-school high-kicking cheer leader in 0.3 seconds on the sinking of a single putt.  Now that will kill your ambient feng-shui.  &ldquo;Screw your putt, I&rsquo;m creating masterpieces here!&rdquo; &mdash; St. John&rsquo;s Jim</p>\r\n<p>So I was lucky and was able to tease Pathy, Winnie&rsquo;s sister, into telling me a few of the juiciest gossip around town.  She walked me around her quiet garden pointing out her Ida Lupino Lupines and her Mexicali Roses.  Leo and Station walked up the alley and waved, we waved back.<br />\r\nWinnie called out: &mdash; &ldquo;How are the classes going?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Station put himself in an Indonesian martial arts stance and made a big grin.</p>\r\n<p>Leo chortled &ldquo;Fabulous!  And we LOVE your slugs!&rdquo; &mdash; they looked at each other and the two men disappeared into their house.</p>\r\n<p>I mentioned that they seemed to have patched up their relationship.  I have never seen these two talk to each other, let alone walk side by side.  And now they were openly affectionate.</p>\r\n<p>Pathy said: &ldquo;Yes, they are giving web-video sex-wrestling classes now!  Can you believe it?&rdquo;<br />\r\nAt that moment Leo bounded up to me, thrusting a hand bill at me, saying &ldquo;Bodies just want to have fun.  Let yours loose more often!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On the front it had the headline: &ldquo;Bodies Just Want to Have Fun,&rdquo; along with some marketing BS about it being Shaolin inspired. &mdash; I fell into the trap and stupidly asked: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo bubbled in his kind of too technical way: &ldquo;The goal of level 1 is to be able to get the partner to &lsquo;detachment&rsquo; which is identified as to have uncontrollable breathing, moans, and shouts of &lsquo;Yes, yes, God YeS!&rsquo;&rdquo; &mdash; He winked a bit and said: &ldquo;Some Marines have been known to shout &lsquo;More P.T. Sargent!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>[First Name], I&rsquo;m pretty much over those kinds of military exercises, and not being so hot on &ldquo;Yes, Yes, God Yes,&rdquo; I ventured a lame &ldquo;Three Cheers&rdquo; as my indicator. &nbsp; Leo shot me a patronizing look, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a start.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo turned to Pathy and said: &ldquo;Station will come again at 2AM to clean the slugs out of your peppers, OK?&rdquo;  That seemed to make Pathy happy and Leo went back inside where Station was calling out: &ldquo;Hurry up, Leo!  We only have two minutes to get ourselves fluffed before we start the web-cam stream.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I looked at Pathy and asked: &ldquo;Are those two going live with their video sex wrestling?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pathy replied: &ldquo;Yes, I thought those two would never get back together.  Station&rsquo;s family in the South Pacific had cut him off, and Leo&rsquo;s last internet spy gig went very bad.  They were both in the pits of depression.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I said: &ldquo;Yeah, I thought their energy was way out of kilter for a pair of guys living together.  What happened?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pathy went on: &ldquo;It was my habanero peppers and those nasty slugs.  A couple of weeks ago, we were here in the garden.  It was like this &mdash;</p>\r\n<p>Pathy is pointing to the remains of a seed pod.  &ldquo;And it even ate my habanero!  I think it&rsquo;s slugs!  Uggh.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Station says: &ldquo;In my culture, anything that can transmute the habanero is highly prized. We call it Mana-Bo-Banana-Fana-Mana.  It is very rare to hold and concentrate the habanero energy. Imagine the huge appetite of it's Chi-overflow protection system! It must hold the plant-energy of the habanero so that it can be released in chakras of amazing BooKoo!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo looks at Station and says: &ldquo;BooKoo?  Like we used to have?&rdquo;  Station looks at Leo and their eyes soften a bit.  In a flash, Station is combing the underleaves like his tropic ancestors.</p>\r\n<p>Pathy looks startled as Station holds out his prize to her.  He says: &ldquo;Pathy, here it is.&rdquo;  It starts oozing up his wrist.</p>\r\n<p>Pathy looks at it with disgust, &ldquo;Slugs, ugh, get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Leo and Station are suddenly very chatty as they quickly walk back to their home. Halfway there, Leo slid the thing off of Station&rsquo;s shoulder onto his hand.  They giggled.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash; At least that&rsquo;s what Pathy tells me. &nbsp;In Portland, where we have an annual <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kptv.com/news/28278209/detail.html\">Nude-Bike-A-thong</a>, her story sounds no more bizarre than any of Sandy&rsquo;s stories about mutant mammal-arachnids, or Roger&rsquo;s death by our fungal overlords, but there it is. You have read all about those and other stories right here, on the St. John's Lighthouse. &nbsp;In black and white.  Or whatever your text screen rendering makes it.</p>\r\n<p>&mdash; So, kids of all ages,  don&rsquo;t hold me responsible for any  mollusca-banero snacks you come across!  And keep your sex-wrestling in top form: It is all Leo&rsquo;s and Station&rsquo;s idea.</p>"

  Subject: "Shanghai Squirrels by the Score"
  Message: "<p><span style=\"display: none; \" id=\"1309567859575S\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>The squirrels have taken over.  I am writing this as I watch helplessly as they forage all day long. &nbsp;I want their fuzzy tail for my hat, but all my traps have been sprung by raccoons using duct tape.  How the hell did raccoons figure out duct tape is beyond me, but my sources are honest, WGAF church-goers from the Hope for Health Bar and Grease Pit.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, Southwick tells me a buddy of Tommy, his landlord, is making big money from the squirrel-racoon-nutria triangle near Pier Park.  In fact, that he is making a fortune from the internet cloud crowd.</p>\r\n<p>Now Tommy is not the kind of guy you would trust to know anything about anybody.  He may know, but what comes out of his mouth has no bearing on what he may know. &nbsp;I have to doubt Southwick on this one.</p>\r\n<p>So I ask Southwick: &quot;Come on, buddy, Tommy tells you all sorts of things.  Like the time he ice skated on the deck of a barge going over the Columbia Bar.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick gets all excited like he was there: &quot;Tommy says it&rsquo;s the fastest way to get around on one of those big rigs! It was a cold winter that year.   And anyway, I have seen Sam&rsquo;s place myself, er, my buddy&rsquo;s place.  I&rsquo;ll take you.  Tommy wants me to drop off a box near at Ella&rsquo;s, er, another buddy&rsquo;s place near there. Er, I got some shit to do: you should come with.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Some shit to do? &nbsp;That does NOT sound like Southwick. &nbsp;Not even when he having hurling duets with Sandy out behind the Hope for Health Bar and Cardiac Arrest First Response Center (Special Happy hour for Ambulance Drivers!).</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">Sam, it turns out, used to work with Tommy over at Waterfront U. -- Sam was two weeks short of his retirement when he was hit with a sex harassment charge from one of the office staff, a Miss Big, a cousin of Mr. Big,  it&rsquo;s a family business, you know.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">In secret negotiations, Tommy&rsquo;s stirring defense of Sam won Tommy the coveted Ethics Chair: &ldquo;Maybe yes, maybe no.  Who cares. Either way we dump him before his retirement gets vested.  Good job to everybody.  I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It seems that Sam operates a humane catch-and-release service, but he doesn&rsquo;t really release many, just enough to stay legal.  I find out that most of the squirrels and raccoons are &ldquo;damaged in transit&rdquo; or &ldquo;mis-routed&rdquo; to Sam&rsquo;s profit.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick and I arrive over at Sam&rsquo;s place. &nbsp;It has lots of &quot;animals around Jesus&quot; kind of pictures in the yard.</p>\r\n<p>I ask Sam, &quot;So how does this catch and release stuff work?  Why don&rsquo;t you just kill the suckas?  I mean they are not a protected species, are they?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sam says, &quot;Tommy&rsquo;s been really good to me since I got canned.  He helped set me up and had some good connections so I have a reliable income now. &nbsp; Southwick suggested I get better press from the &ldquo;humane&rdquo; thing.  Tommy tells me it&rsquo;s fashionable protection against getting lez-bombed in some parts of Oregon this millennium, but the methods are timeless. Harvest &lsquo;em, Sell &lsquo;em.  The internet is the best.  I like Plague&rsquo;s List, where they have the end-times survival marketplace.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I ignore the gender slur and thank Sam for the tip; End-times talk is all the rage now, and we have so many options for destruction.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">In the 50's, when we only had nuclear destruction, I kinda liked the fall-out shelter idea.  It &ldquo;sounded&rdquo; good and gave us a much needed cultural crutch as we fought economic warfare against the USSR.  Today, with our 2,000 cable channels of end-time options, we don&rsquo;t seem to have a viable National Crutch.  Should we feel all warm and fuzzy from Pat-downs at the airport? Inoculations to protect against super-bug bacteria? &nbsp;And let's not forget fall-out shelters as we pull the wool over our own eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Sam shows me the certifications from Animal Control and Health.  Sam can run his operation at least till the inspector shows up.  Could be months or years.  A viable business opportunity. &nbsp;The rule in Tommy County, Oregon, is that it is only Multnomah County when the cops are near.</p>\r\n<p>As we walk out to his garage he says: &ldquo;Hell, if there are not enough critters in a neighborhood, I&rsquo;ll release &lsquo;em and come back next year.  They breed <i>real</i> good.&rdquo;  He leans into me as he says &quot;real&quot; and his breath smells like wine.  He continues:  &ldquo;I used to exterminate rats, still do, but the market for free range rat meat just isn&rsquo;t what it used to be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He points out the main holding cages.  There is a TV there showing instructional videos on how to use duct tape to spring home-made traps.  The animals watch intently.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick chimes in with his goody-goody side: &quot;Sounds like a public nuisance.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sam gets all excited, like a cable channel preacher: &quot;That&rsquo;s why the humane thing is Sooo important!  It&rsquo;s a Public SERVICE.  A strong ecology needs a visionary like me to insure the full future of this precious resource of nature.  The PNW Squirrel!  If a neighborhood is lacking in this essential element of the Flow of Nature, I am just helping out.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick glows with momentary enthusiasm: &quot;Thank You So Much! You are so Right!  Let nature have abundant resources!&quot; &nbsp;He often return to sanity by morning, so I let it pass.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a bit taken aback by Sams &ldquo;high-road&rdquo; argument, but I hear similar things coming from other highly doubtful, but highly placed authorities.  Who am I to say that Sam is not a visionary?  I&rsquo;m not sure I like his vision, or even if he has a vision, but he seems serious. Maybe I should just shoot him now.</p>\r\n<p>I venture: &quot;So a large population of squirrels is good ecology?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sam is less the preacher, and more the businessman: &quot;Yeah, no matter if people want more or less of the little buggers, I get the big bucks!  I relocate in either direction.  I&rsquo;m providing a needed service.  Southwick needs to keep the little suckas out of his tomatoes.  My 'ultra painless, no scare, humane, catch-and-release because we care' service is tailor made for Southwick&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>I come to the point: &quot;Actually, I only want the tail.  It would look cool as a hat-band.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Sam gets ultra-business: &ldquo;Oh, no.  I don&rsquo;t sell the tails.  MMmm.  No. Bad business.  Only the complete animal.    I only sell in lots of 20 anyway. Live, or gutted and frozen.  If you want skins, you might talk to Ella next door.  She is one of my best customers. &nbsp;She's a bit off in the head from all the weird chemicals she uses.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Before we leave,&nbsp;Southwick picks up a score: a box of 20 frozen, urban range fed squirrels.&nbsp; Then he and I go the short distance to Ella&rsquo;s place.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px; \">I'm wondering if Ella is another of Tommy's &quot;network.&quot; &nbsp;Let's find out next time.</p>"

  Message: "<p>I want a squirrel tail for my hat. &nbsp;Southwick is taking me on a tour of back-woods St. John's, deep into Tommy County to find out what uses they have found for a permanent Pacific Northwest resource: the common squirrel. &nbsp;The residents there say the county line is 50 feet around the nearest cop.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick tells me that Ella used to work at Waterfront U. &nbsp;There was a scandal about embezzling that Ella got caught up in, and that Tommy was instrumental in keeping Ella out of jail.</p>\r\n<p>Ella has small house near a wildlife preserve. &nbsp;Ella laughs a lot.  Weird laugh.  She is small and shriveled.  It looks like a life of cigarette smoke has sucked her vital essences and replaced them with creosote.  She could be 75, she could be 45.  Impossible to tell. There is a bench and vials of odd chemicals, tools and jigs for carving, shaping and mounting.</p>\r\n<p>Ella has a notebook of photos of her work. The squirrels are in many poses. &nbsp;There is a &quot;moments from history&quot; section - &nbsp;Washington Crossing the Delaware, Lincoln's assasination, raising the flag at Iwo Jima, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire\">Triangle Fire</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcW_Ygs6hm0\">Major King Kong</a>. Serious stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most, though, are riding in cars or on motorcycles. A few are in Kama Sutra positions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She talks taxidermy: &ldquo;I still use the old formulas.  It&rsquo;s hard to get arsenic and mercury any more, but Tommy can get anything.  Toxic Tommy!&rdquo; She picks up a syringe and starts poking it into her work. She cackles. She starts to wheeze.</p>\r\n<p>I ask her about the old formulas: &quot;Arsenic and mercury are really nasty poisons that keep on killing, how can you use them so close to the nature preserve?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Ella replies: &quot;Where do you think Tommy gets the stuff from? &nbsp;This is the Willamette! &nbsp;He hauls out a ton, and I put back in a pound. &nbsp;It's cap and trade, baby. &nbsp;It's sustainable.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick pulls the package from Tommy.  Ella opens it: a group of squirrels enjoying Da Vinci&rsquo;s &lsquo;last supper.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>She reads the note: &ldquo;Tommy says it&rsquo;s too high-brow to have them on chairs.  He thinks he can sell it if I put the squirrels on motorcycles. Tommy&rsquo;s been real good to me, what a great guy.  He really helped me after that awful business over at Waterfront U.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>She asks me if I want anything, and I ask the price of a squirrel's tail.</p>\r\n<p>She replies:&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I only sell the whole pelt. &nbsp;I got a reputation, you know. I tell you what I can do, is to mount one on the front of your brim.  I do good work.&rdquo;  She points to one with squid tentacles where its head should be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Nice work. I&rsquo;ll pass on a hat mounted stuffed squirrel.  I just want the tail for a hat-band.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ella: &ldquo;Nope, not much call for a squirrel without a tail. &nbsp;I got a reputation. &nbsp;The whole thing or nothing.&rdquo;  She starts cackling and wheezing repeating: &ldquo;a squirrel without a tail!&rdquo; and &ldquo;the WHOLE thing&rdquo; over and over like it is some sort of in-joke.  Mercury in the brain, I guess.  She starts to wheeze then straightens up, and asks me: &quot;Would ya fight for one? &nbsp;You can get into the ring.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I'm confused: &quot;Fight? Who? What?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Southwick gets one of those &quot;I'm gonna tell your mommie&quot; looks on his face and says &quot;Oh, no, Animal Fights? That's horrible&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>She looks me in the eye. &nbsp;She says: &quot;This is why we don't like outsiders. &nbsp;We don't talk about things to outsiders -- Are YOU an outsider?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I notice the syringe needle in her hand and I put my voice into 'soothe the beast' mode and walk slowly backward: &quot;Uhh. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I'm totally OK. &nbsp;Southwick is cool, you know him. &nbsp;He's my good buddy.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She goes on: &quot;Tommy says Southwick can't do any harm, so he's OK.&quot; &nbsp;She explains: &quot;You can fight any animal you want in Pioneer's Pit. We have it on the last thursday of the month. &nbsp;Man against Nature. &nbsp;No guns allowed.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I'm a bit stunned. &nbsp;&quot;Pioneer's Pit?&nbsp;No guns? How does that work?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>She goes on: &quot;You get five minutes in the pit. &nbsp;Squirrel, nutria, raccoon -- your pick. Max points going into the pit barehanded. &nbsp;When I'm judging, I give extra points for skin exposure.&quot; &nbsp;She winks at me.</p>\r\n<p>I reply, &quot;What kind of match is it?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>She starts to rant: &quot;Pioneer! That's what men were like in the old days. &nbsp;Fighting the wilds of nature: Man to Grizzly. With only a knife. &nbsp;That's not sustainable. &nbsp;We just don't have enough grizzleys to go around, and most of the men today are such wimps that they couldn't take on a pack of wolves let alone a puma. &nbsp;We gotta get back to that good pioneer spirit. &nbsp;The city-fied geeks over in Intel-town are lining up to get their scars with squirrels. It's gentrification! It's sustainable.&quot; &nbsp;She has a fury in her that would last about 10 minutes for any audience. &nbsp;Just long enough to get consensus.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Think you can take on a raccoon? &nbsp;I tell you what. &nbsp;Nutrias are the easiest. You go in with this syringe, I guarantee it. &nbsp;You win the fight, I'll give you a big discount on mounting it on your hat.&quot; She shows me the squid-head thing again. &nbsp;She looks me up and down and says: &quot;Like I said -- I give extra points for skin exposure. &nbsp;You go in completely bare, and I'll give you an <i>extra</i> special discount. On mounting.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I thank Ella for her time, explaining that I'm scheduled for heart surgery on the last Thursday of every month. &nbsp;For many months. &nbsp;We leave.</p>\r\n<p>Southwick tells me he needs to make one more stop with his case of frozen squirrel.</p>"

  Message: "<p>A cheerful guy, for a street person.  Cheerful and connected.  He looks normal, only tiny bit odd, until you notice that he has no eyebrows at all.  Everybody calls him Nobrow.</p>\n<p> He sleeps in a junkyard.  Has a girlfriend on heroin.  She wanted $20 for a fix, and Nobrow wouldn't give it to her.  She went off an hour earlier with another guy who was going to get her a fix.</p>\n<p>He sipped his beer and often looked across the street at the bus stop and replayed that moment.  He described the look they had exchanged through the bus window.  A mixture of defiance, surrender and regret all rolled into one.  Nobrow wistfully said he was going to spend a month at a friend's farm and live outside until the cold came on strong.</p>\n<p>We shared a brew at Slim's in St. John one afternoon.  The call of nature broke up our conversation, and when I came back to the bar he was talking on the phone.  \"... Yes, love you.  I just wanted you to keep on the up and up, and not make the mistakes your old man's done.  ...  Your dad hasn't had a drink or anything today, honey.\"    \"... No, It's not right that he punched you.  ...  Go get in contact with the half-way house we had talked about. \", He went on like that for a few minutes.   \"I love you.

His daughter, his ex-wife, his brother...</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It's the connections.  We each have a few.  Let them slide away only at great peril to the resident.  John Donne spoke of the promontories of humanity with \"no man is an island.\"  The promontories of our personal firmament are composed of these gossamer connections.  The loss of one, even a tenuous and difficult connection, is grounds for sorrow.  And in a troubled life, even a difficult connection is a haven.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">When we run out of havens, what will we do?  I'm glad Nobrow has safe havens for the resident of his world.  He will be cheerful and connected with reality at least as long as he exchanges love with his personal support group.</p>"

  Subject: "The Great Aerial Tram Station"
  Message: "<p>Just a few days ago Pathy and Winnie Daough were sitting at the table sharing their day: Pathy has just submitted her haiku for the Bus System.  The bus system puts up poems on placards and pay $500 for a winning submission.  “The young boy stretches - upward to knowwhere - Final Fantasy gets funky”.  Winnie calmly mentions that Pathy has all the wrong syllables in the wrong lines.  Pathy sighs: “I didn’t think it was very good either, but I’m my worst critic.  Anyway, I entered it in the pre-teen category.”</p>\n<p>Winnie says: “Knowwhere??? Final Fantasy gets Funky? It doesn’t mean anything.” Pathy replies: “That’s what makes poetry so powerful: it’s so deep.”</p>\n<p>Winnie changes the subject: “I got my boarding platform all finished.  Clothesline, pulleys, pallets, a couple of tire rims and a treadmill.  All out of found materials!  All I need to do is run an extension cord out there as soon as I get this old florescent shop light fixed.  Then it will be all done!”</p>\n<p>Winnie has been working with the Baltimore Woods Tree-Top Tram commission to link up all the pre-WWII kid's tree houses with a Swiss style tram.  Very upscale and trendy.  Winnie wanted to have it finished before the next big earthquake hits.  After that, Baltimore Wood will likely turn into Baltimore Landslide and Sink Hole.</p>\n<p>Pathy says: “Oh, good.  I was hoping to take it tomorrow: I never liked climbing that giant maple.  The sap is too sticky this time of year.”</p>\n<p>Just then, there is a knock at the door.  Station pops his head in and says: “Winnie, You home??  You won’t believe what I got to tell you!  You have to promise never to tell.”</p>\n<p>He comes in and acts a bit like he is going to announce the merger of GE, AT&amp;T and Exxon: “I promised Leo that I wouldn’t tell <em><strong>anyone.</strong></em>\" He continues in a hushed tone: \"We have had some complaints about our sex-wrestling classes.”</p>\n<p>Winnie gets a worried look: “Did someone get hurt?”</p>\n<p>Station replies: “Oh, no, nothing like that — we don’t <em>even</em> introduce feathers until level six. It’s the boarding platform for the tram.  You know, our web-cam is set up so the platform is in the background for our web-seminars, and some people waiting on the platform might get broadcasted around the world.”</p>\n<p>Pathy asks, “Broadcasted? Might? So who complained?”</p>\n<p>Station starts talking faster: “Complaints, I mean not so much complaints as angry customers… Yes, maybe Angry Customers.  That’s right, I speak it correctly this time.”</p>\n<p>Pathy says: “So nobody has been \"broadcasted,\" but what have your customers complained about?  Who is angry?”</p>\n<p>Station says: “Did I say angry? Well, no one angry yet, but I know that they will, and I’m <em>sooo</em> worried that Leo might need to move the camera.  The web-cam in our training room has a view of the St. John’s Bridge through trees and the vacant industrial park.”</p>\n<p>Station stretches his arms and waves his hands in the sweeping arc of the bridge. “And the classic beauty of the Bridge is for the camera, otherwise live sex-wrestling classes would be pornographic, you know.” He pauses with his arms and legs stretched in a pose like some old time hood ornament.</p>\n<p>He shifts his vocal transmission to first gear, get out of the ditch conspiracy: “But I know that you won’t tell Leo that I mentioned it.  We promised him.  Bye.”</p>\n<p>Pathy says: “Station sounds like my lawyer ex-husband.  Anyway, I’d think they would not really want people to know exactly where they live.”</p>\n<p>Pathy looks in Winnie’s direction.  Winnie gets a look of resolve: “I gotta move the platform!  It’s the only way to not have to tell Leo.”  Pathy sighs.  Winnie can go off like a rocket without a tail section.</p>\n<p>Pathy: “But you just finished it!  And we don’t even know know if Leo…  And I was… ”  Her voice trails off as she sees Winnie pulling out the guy wires. The platform tilts like the Titanic.</p>\n<p>All through the next five days, Winnie  climbs up the tree, hooks her leg around a limb, leans out to take the platform apart, and lowers a piece down to the ground.  Every so often she sounds like a Marine as she grunts “Hooo--ahh!” and pops a fart for extra power.</p>\n<p>Winnie says: “I’ve got it all figured out.  If I move it to the other side of the tree and put up a couple of faucets  from the bathroom on the side facing Leo and Stations’ place, it will look like part of the scenery!  It will blend right in with the vacant industrial park.  Kind of like the ruins of some future civilization.”</p>\n<p>Pathy asks: “Will we be able to use the bathroom?”</p>\n<p>Winnie replies: “I got that all figured out.  I’ll just run a hose out to the platform and back.  We will just need to go up to the tram to turn the water on or off.”</p>\n<p>Pathy sighs and goes back to composing the perfect haiku: “tornado howls in tongues, quiet spaces grow precious, Future ruins live today.”</p>\n<p>Maybe someday Pathy will learn to count syllables.  We can only hope.</p>"

  Subject: "XII - The Hanged Man"
  Message: "<p>I walked down the hill to the water flowing below.  I was thirsty and this was the freshest water around.  Certified by the government, you know.  The closest good water to here is 5 days walk south, and it does not taste as good as this.  Soon this river will join the sea and it will be worthless.  Best to drink it here.</p>\n<p>The old bridge is still there.  It can still be used, but we don't need to have trucks carrying things around anymore.   Just like grand central station.  We just don't ride trains anymore, but we still keep it up and working.  There are other, better ways to get most things around.  And it's the same with the bridge.  Very few trucks, but we use it just enough to keep it up and in perfect condition.  People just walk more now.  We figured it was better than cars which burned fuel.  Bad for the planet.  Better to keep it going.  Technology helps, like the weekly contact machines.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as I got to the bottom near the bridge supports, I heard a shout from above, a cry actually, but one of joy rather than terror or pain.  When I look up I see an old man falling head first with a cord tied on his foot.  He is bungee jumping.  I have heard of it, but never seen anyone do it anymore.  It used to be in vogue, but now is very rare.   He bounces up and down a few times and I climbed up the support a ways to better talk with him as his bouncing slowed and he just hung there for a while.</p>\n<p>Hi, who are you?</p>\n<p>I'm Jake,  You might know me as the Hanged Man.  I've used that nickname for ever.  When we thought bungee jumping would be big, real big, we all had nicknames.   There are very few of us anymore, and really spread out.  I still do it though.  I've got a whole robotic outfit that tests the system, deploys and retrieves the load (that's me) all under my control.  It's totally rad.</p>\n<p>I asked him if it hurt to have the blood in his head.</p>\n<p>Yea, so what.  It what I do. My system is better at handling it than others, and so, it gives me the most fun, with the least pain.  For me.</p>\n<p>So, Jake, you endure this painful, solitary thing, and you do this from choice, and because of the rush of joy it seems to give you?  And you are happy with that choice?</p>\n<p>Oh, yes, what a fool you are, don't you know we must be happy with our choice?  Even if it is the \"wrong\" one.  If we have made a choice and REALLY chosen, we must learn to be happy from the consequence of that choice.  And when you realize that, you will have realized this important truth.  Choose wisely, choose randomly, but choose, or you are hung between the past and the future.  And learn to love what you get.  Your life can't really be YOUR show, until you make choices.   Then learn to love the results.  In fact, the more life choices you make, the better you are at making them.</p>\n<p>If you don't find love in the results, then you have not learned this important lesson, have you?</p>\n<p>He slowly moved up as his robotic gear came to life high above us.  I moved back down the slopes to get that fresh, fresh water.  It was 3 days more before the next contact was due.   So I'm going to make the most of the 3 days left before I make my next transfer.  I'm sure what he said is true, and I will love the three days I have here to think about it.</p>\n<p> </p>"

  Message: "<p>Make things as serious as you want, but never more than they need -- St. John's Jim</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">August is like Summer's catalyst that forces plants into harvest mode.  The plants know.  They have known for eons.  They just take that catalyst and product what we harvest.  What that exact catalyst might be is different for each species.  Duration of the day?  Spectrum of light? Humidity? Some wierd pheromone secreted by slugs? </p>\n<p>It’s Saturday market day in St. John’s.  It’s August.  Nice.  It will stay that way all day.  I’m walking over to the James John Cafe and have to cover my tracks to keep it’s location secret.  I take the complicated route through the farmer’s market.  Just then, a father comes trudging by on his way to the car. His son, a cute poster-boy for the terrible twos, is about to make his big move.</p>\n<p>Father drudges along with a bouquet of flowers, his hand steadying and assisting the boy on the wooden trike.  You know, one of those walk-em push-em kind that are so earth-wise trendy.</p>\n<p>I’m familiar with the man's problems.  It’s called family life, and it’s a pain in the butt:</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>The kid can’t pedal a trike with no pedals, It’s some cruel grown-up trick designed to make you drive an automatic in later life.  Right now, the kid is just feeling frustration as that crappy wooden seat bangs his thighs at each step.</li>\n<li>The father is carrying flowers and is a bit of a hurry.  Obviously this is not a trip for his own entertainment: no fishing trip with the buddies this morning, dad.  Get the kid out of mom’s hair for a while, and bring some flowers back. </li>\n</ul><p>The son is wobbly on his three wheeler and gets off to push, then gets on, wonders why it isn’t moving.  He complains to dad, who just says, “come along.”  The tot looks around and sees a beautiful cake through a shop window.  The boy’s mind instantly goes into party mode.  <em>Want party. Want.  Now. PARTY!</em></p>\n<p>The boy bolts through the entrance.  Dad calls out: “Stay here.  Don’t go inside.  Come back.  Come back.”  Don’t talk so much, Dad.  Just take action.  So, juggling his load, dad runs into the store, his kid now making a bee line for the tables in back.  The kids mind is locked on the idea of crawling up on some friendly mommy style lap and scamming some cake.</p>\n<p>At the very moment those grimy tot fingers reach out to climb up a matron’s dress, dad scoops the child up and walks back outside.</p>\n<p>I wait and as he comes out I look on with appreciation and sigh: “Good Times.”  The man eases for a fraction of a second from his stern lecture, looks at me and smiles a bit in spite of the predicament.  He knows that I know.</p>\n<p>He heads over to the car with truculent baby, who is strangely silent under the barrage of warnings about not wandering off in strange directions.  I pick up the trike and walk it over to his car.  He says thanks and smiles more broadly as his kid is safely stowed out of harms way.</p>\n<p>For a fraction of a second, he could step outside the moment and appreciate the laughter underneath: that every parent of grown children has had to deal with those terrible twos: and lived.</p>\n<p>This is the stuff that daily life is all about.  Little events.  Seeming problems.  Endless caretaking.   Oh, no!  The babies both have projectile vomiting.  The cat box leaks and the floor underneath has leprosy.  The handle came off in your hand as you tried to get in the van during the hailstorm.  Those kinds of things catch our minds up in “the heat of the moment.”  But as the years allow that heat to cool, around about the maturity of August, laughter and compassion become the emotions surrounding those old moments.  Quite a better harvest, you know.</p>\n<p>I look at the many folks in the market square.  Most are at that pre-laughter, heat of the moment, state of dealing with life in these United States.  But really, how serious is serious?  And need it really be solemn?  There is a big difference, you know.  Like the difference between humans and corporations.  St John’s Jim once famously said: “Make things as serious as you want, but never more than they need.”</p>\n<p>For dad, my casual “good times” comment is like a catalyst to get to laughter just below the surface.  I wonder what might for the rest of us?  For me, I take laughter in my own ability to get in my own way, and that it all works out.  Mostly.</p>\n<p>What catalyst might connect any of these market folks with the cosmic laughter of life?  More importantly, what catalyst might connect you, [First Name], to the laughter just below the surface of your life?</p>\n<p>That catalyst might be closer than you think — Even at the time, distressing as it was to comfort a son and daughter, both burning with fever, sitting on my lap and dueling with projectile vomit, I had to admit to myself: “That’s the craziest thing I ever saw.”</p>\n<p>How about you, [First Name]?  It’s August, and even though it has been known to rain frozen turkeys on August 15th, you gotta admit it’s a pretty good life.  All day long.  What will unlock that harvest of laughter and compassion?</p>"

Did you know I used to have a monkey?  It thought all the time and figured it was in charge, so I traded my monkey for you, Discernment. I lost my mind and came to my senses.  Later on, I'll teach you that you really are not a dog, but right now, it works out just fine.</p>\n<p>And the dog replied: \"I'm not a real dog? What the... That's what  I get for talking to a fool.  And not just any fool, This Fool of all Fools. I better watch this guy pretty closely, or we will both be killed.\"</p>\n<p>Hey, wait, Dizzy, where are you going?  You'll get us lost, oh, look, what a good dog, you found a path.  Let's go see what is just ahead...</p>"

You may remember it from [RogerObt]</p>\n<p>Roger never caught on.  You see, [first name], [death:Death] was not in the manual of Preventative Maintenance, nor was it part of the Ph.D program in “minding your own business” that Roger was pursuing.</p>\n<p>He moves a bit more stiffly now, since he is all dehydrated, and he’s covered in a white web of fungus.   In fact, he hardly moves at all,  In fact, if you saw him you would likely mistake him for a diseased bush.</p>\n<p>So the residents of 3 Gunas LP were totally unaware of Roger out front with his Pickup and trailer.</p>\n<p>He gets out, checks his tires, goes through his 12 point post journey checklist.  He uses the list for any trip he goes on.  His list for leaving covers 87 check points.  In his present dead state, he needs to be careful that the morning glories don’t trip him up.  Still, for a dead fungus guy, he got it done in record time.</p>\n<p>Roger knocks on the door.  Tommy answers and shouts: “Hey, Southwick, did you screw somebody? It wasn’t me this time. They dumped garbage on the porch again.”</p>\n<p>Southwick comes down from his tower keep, takes one look and says: “Roger!  We thought you died over on the coast somewhere.  Wassuuup?  You look like a Santa Claus made out of an old two by four.”</p>\n<p>Roger’s eyes are completely covered by white webs, and he speaks in a raspy hiss: “Old lady kicked me out, said everything smelled musty. Life sux when your dead.”</p>\n<p>Tommy busts out, and says: “You better not have lost your pensions —You still collecting?”</p>\n<p>Roger says: “Yup, I just login and click.

Looks just like me.</p>\n<p>When I went in I noticed the sawdust on the ground was still fresh in this sideshow, even though the fair had been running for a full ten days.  Not many people come into the death tent.  But, it is true, the quiet lady that runs this concession actually owns all the acts in the fair.  This one is her favorite, she doesn't have to work too hard, and she does it for love rather than the money it generates.</p>\n<p>First thing, she said \"Look, here are pictures of my dead children --- Guillermo, Anastasia, run, bring your baby pictures\" she smiled kindly at my expression of confusion and disbelief --- \"Ah, you think I'm off in the head, but look at these babies and look at Guillermo and Anastasia.  I will never hold either of them over my head and kiss their tummies as we dance and play.  These babies are only images on paper, and memories in my head. They are as dead as if they were buried in the ground\"</p>\n<p>\"But, but...\" I spluttered, \"here they are, alive!\"</p>\n<p>\"You still not getting it, eh? Yes, these are my children, but the ones in the picture are of the tiny babies they were.

And approach the day with anticipation. A photograph can only show what was.  The instant the shutter clicks can only record the last moment of that person.  That person will never hold that exact moment ever again.  Time kills us and rebirths us every moment in true creation.  Whether the transformation is slow, like the growth of a child, or swift, like a fall from a tower, matters not.\"</p>\n<p>\"It doesn't feel like I'm dead.\"</p>\n<p>\"nope, it doesn't: never does, never will.  What did it feel like before you were born and conceived? Our stupid thinking brain only thinks it knows anything. Even death, yes?  How stupid of it to not know the truth because Death has no effect on the life essence.  It is yet another change.</p>\n<p>\"You, your old you, died at this very moment.  You have the opportunity to put all your old life, thoughts, emotions away.  Give them up and see everything with new eyes.  Give up anything in your old life that does not support your highest good.</p>\n<p>\"Now would you like me to take your photograph so you can show your friends a picture of the dead?  Only five dollars\"</p>"

  Subject: "The Cougar Returns!"
  Message: "<p>Thereasa hangs up the phone and her mind races with possibilities — What happened to her current cub?  He was supposed to keep the shop running while she presented her research papers to the secret gathering of NonSaneO and C.I.X. agents.  If even one of her “beasties” turned up in the wrong hands, there could be public outrage — rioting in the streets as people realized the dangers of venomous eight legged web-spinning raccoons, bats, and even bears.</p>\n<p>Thereasa recognized that the missing Steven was only a small part of her problem.  And having to report to Detective Tamworth was the first step.  That would be an easy fix:</p>\n<p>Thereasa looks across the banquet room until she spots what she is looking for.  She walks up and says: “Hello again Stan, One of your detectives just called me.  A guy named Tamworth.  I’m to see him at 10 on Monday.  Make sure he pronounces my name right.”</p>\n<p>Back in St. John’s, Thereasa goes straight to her tree top estate in the cedar canopy of Forest park.  She finds that all her bugs have gone wild in the last few days.  “Damn, It’s the full moon.  The bugs all go hyperactive and the full hunter’s moon must have been a problem for Steve.”  Still, there were no signs that any of her bugs had done any damage: Steve had restrained them properly.  It seems that he just left.  But where?</p>\n<p>It took hours for her to calm her little friends and get them into “afterglow.” Finally at 2AM, relieved that her secret ranch in the treetops is undisturbed, she sleeps the sleep of exhausted.  The next morning she heads over the the St. John’s police station.</p>\n<p>Detective Tamworth: “Mr. Steven Boitoi has gone missing.  He was reported to our department last Saturday.  It seems that no one has seen him since Wednesday.”</p>\n<p>TC — “I have been out of town since last Sunday.  Steve and I went to the airport together.  He saw me off, and sent me an e-mail the next day.  Any further questions and I will want a lawyer present.”</p>\n<p>DT — “I have no more questions at this time.”  As he says this he pulls out a photo from his notes, and lays it down on the table.  It is a grainy, blurred image of an 8 legged raccoon lounging high up in a tree at Pier Park.  The detective looks closely for any reaction.</p>\n<p>Squinting a bit at the photo, she says: “What’s that?”</p>\n<p>DT — “I thought you might tell me, Ms Koogray.”  His voice rises in anticipation of a crack in her demeanor.</p>\n<p>Just at that moment, the detective’s cell phone rings: “Yes?…  Yes, I have Ms. koogray here…  Oh…   Koo GAR Ray, yes, I won’t make that mistake again, Sir…  Yes… I will have all files on your desk when you arrive.  Yes, Sir...  Thank you sir.”</p>\n<p>He turns several shades of red and hurriedly snatches the photo away.  Straigtening up his notes, he turns and says:  “Well, it seems that the Chief himself saw you both at the airport, Ms. Qugaré.  I have no further questions.”</p>\n<p>TC — “I know you are doing your job.  And from the looks of it, you are on a path to become quite a great detective.”  A little powdered sugar up the detective’s ass at a time like this might just pay off.  A little interplanetary Mars-Venus diplomacy might end up in a conjuction.  TC smiles secretly to herself as she leaves the police station.</p>\n<p>Then it hits her.  That picture was not taken in Forest Park!  It wasn't one of her spinners! She had to find out what was happening before St. John's is overrun!</p>\n<p>Next: The Mob Muscles In.</p>"

  Message: "<p>Stan performed on the streets of Portland — Valerie kept Stan alive emotionally so he could scrape together only enough for one.  They split the one 50-50.</p>\n<p>Stan: “Let’s go. This corner is a bummer.”</p>\n<p>Valerie: “You bet, Stan, let’s go to the park up by the Subway and 7-11.  We should be able to get $5 before they close.”</p>\n<p>Stan: “No, we go to the train station, I work better there.”</p>\n<p>Valerie: “their food sux”</p>\n<p>Stan: “Yeah! it sure does. Let’s go.”</p>\n<p>As they walked to the Tri-Met station, Valerie looked up and saw the face stuck on the back of the STOP sign.  The face of an ogre and OBEY! in big letters!</p>\n<p>Valerie: “Stan, What’s the back of a “STOP” sign mean?”</p>\n<p>Stan: “Don’t mean SHiiiiiiiit.”</p>\n<p>Valerie: “Couldn’t the back of STOP mean GO? Couldn’t you work that into a gig somehow?”</p>\n<p>Stan: “That’s pretty cool.  You know that face is modeled after Andre The Giant.  He was a big star. Was in the Princess Bride or something...  No, wrestling.“</p>\n<p>She wondered if the back of a STOP sign should really be a “GO” sign.  She loved Princess Bride, and she remembered the the Giant was a lovable guy, and in the end came to rescue the princess.</p>\n<p>But Valerie was not the story’s distant princess, for her stableboy was a street mime and not a wayfaring pirate returning from unknown ventures.  He WAS a good performer, so it was completely different.  Completely different.  Unless…</p>\n<p>“GO.” “OBEY.” the words and imagery from the Princess Bride tumbled over and over in her head.  If the love is true, the end will be true.</p>\n<p>She pulled out her pack of Tarot cards and drew \"The Tower\" --- And on one moment, she made up her mind.  She will become the princess.  Just like the moment she decided that “Yes” I will get my labia pierced.  Distance.  Stan would NOT like a long distance relationship, but so what?  If he wasn’t up to a challenge, why bother?  Can he ever provide for two?  He always good to me, but he barely gets by, has few long term friends, and loves my body and energy, but what happens?  Can I depend on him?  Can HE depend on him?  Does he have enough Mana? Or is he a mana vampire?</p>\n<p>Calling her uncle in Northern California, she arranges a job in Ft Bragg, and can sleep in his house in exchange for watching kids.  One evening, she makes such passionate love to Stan that he is sent on several errands to the orgasm gods and sleeps the sleep of still waters.</p>\n<p>Valerie buys a ticket and leaves this note for him the next morning:</p>\n<p>“Gawd! I LOOOOVVVVEEE YOU!  I’m addicted to you!!!   But I NEEEEEED to know if you are the one.</p>\n<p>Here is the deal.  This is now a long-distance relationship.  Do not follow me.  The people here would hate street mimes.</p>\n<p>Know that I love and support you in ALL other ways.</p>\n<p>To get back together, you need to be able to buy a house for us to live and have a life together.  I will remain faithful and be in constant contact with you. Phone sex OK.</p>\n<p>I love you.  If you ever want real sex like that again, here are the rules.</p>\n<p>DO NOT ASK ME TO RETURN.</p>\n<p>DO NOT FOLLOW ME.</p>\n<p>Show me what you have in 18 months, we will re-assess.</p>\n<p>Survive, Thrive, Prosper, Learn, Adapt, Love. Love me, Love the future we can create.</p>\n<p>The Goal: A life together, a family, a house.</p>\n<p>Strong Heart.</p>\n<p>Valerie.</p>\n<p>PS. You can do this.  I know it.</p>"

  Subject: "Halloween 2011 -- Early Evening"
  Message: "<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Halloween night, 2011.  It is a new moon and the darkness falls quickly in the Portland Autumn.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Pathy has volunteered to take a group of kids for trick-or-treat in downtown St. John’s.  She sewed her own costume this year as every year.  Last year she dressed up as as Carmen Miranda with a tutti-frutti hat.  This year she decided to be a sunflower with glowing golden petals surround her face.  She figured that sewing little lights to the back of each petal would help light the way.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Instead, she is nearly blinded by the lights around her face and the children are holding her hands to keep her from bumping the telephone poles.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">That was the cause of her leading the kids off the planned route and finding herself on 3 Gunas Lp by Pier Park.  The children run up to the door and knock.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">“Trick or Treat!”  Tommy opens the door. He has nothing.  He considers slamming the door, but instead says “wait a minute.”  He grabs a handful of stuff from the bathroom shelves and jams them into the waiting goodie baskets, saying “Be safe kids.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Pathy sighs and turns: “Follow me children. Hold hands.”  She starts out to the next house, but loses her bearings almost immediately and walks straight into the darkest part of Pier Park.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Pathy stops at a bench and gives the kids a moment to rest. Immediately the kids start looking at the stuff and talking at once: “ook, it’s toothpaste.” “I got a tiny bottle of shampoo.” “Pathy, what’s this?”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Pathy pokes through the kids bags and finds bars of soap from motels.  Another had mouthwash.  There were a couple of condoms in there too.  A small silk bag with red jellied candy.  Pathy made sure that Tommy’s nastiest treats were out of the hands of the kids.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">“Well, I’m not sure how we got here, the ACK!”  Pathy stops short, “What was that!  Quiet, children!  Hush. I bet there is a raccoon over there.  Don’t scare it.” She turns off her lighted costume and gazes into the darkness.  “Did you see that?  It ran right by us!”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">The raccoon wanders in between the cedars, and then seems to climb straight up into the air.  One of the children screams: “It’s a spider!”  Pathy looks carefully and gulps: “Oh, no, it’s just a trick of the light.  Let’s head back to the street!”  Secretly she is scared stiff, but keeps her cool and gets the kids back to Tommy’s house.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">She knocks: “Southwick. Are you there?  I need your help.”  Tommy answers.  “Hey, aren’t you one of Southwick’s friends? I’ll go get him. How’d you like the Halloween treats?  Pretty good that I save the soap and stuff when I go out of town.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick comes down, and after seeing her in such a frightened state agrees to walk the children back to St. John’s.  Southwick wants to know what has got her so upset: “Are you alright?  What happened?”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Pathy tells him about the raccoon: “Honestly, it climbed straight across between two trees about 30 feet up.  It had eight legs!  It dropped this.”  She shows him a small bag full of squares of red jelly candy.  Southwick looks in: “So what?  red jelly candy.”  Pathy explains: “This is the candy that Leo and Station brew up out of my Habanero eating slugs.  Gad I hate those things.  Station and Leo sell it over the internet for their sex wrestling seminars.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick looks at the bag. It’s a silk bag with the initials T.Q.  He hands it back, saying: “I bet Leo and Station are making a killing.  Does this stuff work?”  Pathy replies saying: “I don’t know, they charge too much for it.  It is very special. And you need a partner, you know.”  Southwick looks into Pathy's eyes. She continues: “You know, I'll be handing out treats at home this evening, you could help.”  Southwick blesses his good fortune.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick reassures Pathy and the kids as they make it back to St. John’s. By the time they get back the kids have forgotten everything except how lame Tommy’s treats are.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">As soon as Pathy is gone, Southwick calls The Cougar.  “Hi, TC.  I got some information you might want to know:”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">TC: “Spill it.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick: “Pathy Daough just led a bunch of kids into Pier Park… They saw a raccoon climb around like a spider in the trees.  Are you starting up shop in Pier Park?  I thought you wern’t going to do that.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">TC: “No, it’s not me.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick: “Pathy also had a little silk bag with your initials on it.  The raccoon dropped it.  It had some of Leo and Station’s sex candy in it.  Tommy also put some into  the kid’s trick or treat baskets.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">TC: “My bag? Candy? Tommy?!!”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick: “I’ve seen Steven and Bambi Brew over at the place a couple of times since July.  Tommy has some crazy idea about toxic DNA recycling. Way over my head. But if one of these bugs dropped it, it has to get back to you somehow.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">TC: “Thanks, I’ll take care of it right away.  Just make sure that you are not home at midnight, OK?”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Southwick: “Oh, I don’t think that will be a problem at all tonight.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">The Cougar gives Tommy a call: “We are having a meeting at your place tonight.  Get ready for all the fun you can handle.  Ask Roger what I mean.  Bambi too.  Especially Bambi.  Call me when Bambi is there.  I’ll do you both at the same time.  It’s on me.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">Tommy has heard many, many times Roger’s stories about her fabulous techniques.  “She has the Kama Sutra in her arteries.” according to Roger.  Tommy agrees: “That sounds great.  But I don’t want seconds, I want you to take care of me first.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px 'Times New Roman'; color: #340000;\">TC: “Don’t worry, I’ll give you very, very special care.  Bye-bye.

Midnight. Halloween.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Crap.

Oh, yes, did I mention the spider mouth?  Yea.  It morphs back and forth with the seasons and phases of the moon.  That’s why Halloween is the big day.  The spinners, whether they are bat sized or bear sized, are most active and most needing control at halloween.  It’s in their contract.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Heading out with her Tie and Bib wearing Grizzly-spinner, she makes her way underneath the St. John’s bridge.  Her small army of bugs following in tight formation.  She rides on the giant bug’s back, massaging and cooing in it’s ear, as it bellows orders to the other bugs in silent bug language.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Dropping down into Cathedral Park and skirting the river, she makes her way unnoticed in the darkness to Pier Park.  A quick survey of the tree-tops by her bat-spiders locates all the “pets” that Steven had stolen from her Forest Park compound.  Gathering them to her side, she goes over to 3 Gunas Lp and has her army wait in the shadows.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">She walks up to the door and rings.  “Tommy?  Bambi? are you ready for some fun?”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Tommy answers the door with a towel around his hips: “Hi, I got the hot tub ready.  Wanna fuck?  Bambi’s here and I’ll let you screw him later.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Thereasa Qugare steps back a few feet: “Oh, no, Tommy, that’s not the fun we are going to have tonight.”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Tommy is shocked: “But Roger said you were the best!”</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">The Cougar looks straight at Tommy: “Roger never pissed me off.  Roger was reliable.   Reliability is sexy, Tommy.  You are not.”  She lifts her hand and an army of spider creatures scampers across the street with her flying bat-spiders looping and diving overhead.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Tommy turns white.

  Subject: "Pentacles"
  Message: "<h1>Pentacles -- Dilligent.  Earthy. Prosperity bound.</h1>\n<p>The pentacles are workers creating value through craft, labor and the bounties of nature.  Pentacle energy sustains the sacred space.  On the scale of Maslow's Heirarchy, the pentacles fill up most of the lower rungs - Physiological needs, economic security, and are enablers for other rungs: family, belonging, education.  Maslow's higher stages of actualization: authenticitity, meaningfulness, creativity, en-theos, are not inherently pentacular.</p>\n<p>Pentacle efforts are totally under the control of swords, that is, pentacles need the protection afforded by external laws and internal vigilence.  Swords protect the sacred spaces where pentacles produce the fruit.  Swords steal and destroy the fruits and capabilites of the pentacle.  An uneasy balance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"1\"> </a>Ace of Pentacles</h2>\n<p><strong><em>The realization of worth.</em></strong> You have discovered the basis for continued survival and comfort.  It may be a talent you have, a family recipe passed down through the ages, or a job offer for you.  You will survive.  Know it well so you may make this the cornerstone of your house of life.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"2\"> </a>Two of Pentacles</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>The dance of capabilities.</strong></em> The worth of a single pentacle is more than doubled by the interplay of two.  Dance the dance of integration of your worth.  The second pentacle may be another of your own capabilities or the pentacle of another.  The dance of integration of the two is paramount.  Love the dance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"3\"> </a>Three of Pentacles</h2>\n<p><em><strong>The job.</strong></em> You have found an employer.  Your work is appreciated and you gain from that.  Your employer sets the standards for your work and you do your best to meet those standards.  You employer also sets the value and all else for your work.</p>\n<p>Steady employment, but  with little ability modify the agreement.  Your worth is very much dependent on the situation and the wishes of \"the man\"</p>\n<p>When I visited the bridge the last time, the work had been already completed.  By getting my level three contact privileges, I'm so glad that I got the chance to get here again just after the work started.  I'm really enjoying the hub-bub of the construction.  Totally awesome.</p>\n<p>Today, Dizzy and I walked on to the site.  A couple of workers said that I should have a helmet for the dog, and laughed, but mostly everybody just did their work.  I saw one guy high up on the cables of the bridge.  He was steady, but nimble: goat like -- clearly a master of the high wires.</p>\n<p>I asked around and found that this guy had quite a reputation for being nimble.  After nightfall, anything above the first floor had better be double locked, including your daughter.</p>\n<p>As lunchtime came around, I sat with him for a few moments and asked about his job.  His name was Mike Messer, or something like that, and he kept humming tunes from the \"Threepenny Opera,\" a play that was popular that year.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, I love the plays, my wife Polly used to do a little acting; She was pretty good, and I do a little rigging backstage, you know, lights and scenery:  I get to watch the rehearsals from the catwalks.\"</p>\n<p>\"Show me the way to the next whiskey bar.  Ha, that fits.  That's me, except right now: I got this pretty good job on the bridge.  The job will last for about another year and a half, and then bingo, I have to find another.  I'm paid pretty good, not like most of the other smucks.  I work up high and I get paid for it.  Still, just like those other guys, I don't get no say in how much I get paid, just hope I can work enough hours and get by.  You gotta do what you gotta do, and when times are bad, you just have to hunker down and be OK with bad.</p>\n<p>Like what happened to Fred a couple of months ago: got conked pretty good, he did.  He was out for a couple of days and when he came back, he couldn't keep his balance up high.  He was a good guy, and knew some people, ya know -- so he does what he has to do, ya know?  It's the same with all of us.  We like the pay, but when it dries up or you get bunged up, it's gone.</p>\n<p>Just then a foreman came around and handed Mike a clipboard.  Mike took an sheet of paper and signed the roster on the clipboard.</p>\n<p>Mike made a face, composed himself and went on: \"And all the rules:  They keep coming down with changes.  Cant do this, gotta wait for that, get prepared for a big thing, and then wait.  I'm glad this wasn't a work stoppage notice.  Sometimes we have to wait for some part to come from the other side of the ocean and all that time we don't get paid.  It's always like that -- The big guys make the decisions, and we have to take it on the chin.  And then \"The next whiskey bar\" is just where you can find me.  And maybe like some other things in that play, ya know?  I'm not above the next guy, and when times get tough, you gotta take every option that comes along, ya know?</p>\n<p>Hey, buddy, I can get you a job: they're looking for someone on the hod-carrier circuit.  Pay's pretty good, and I can get you a job on my recommendation if you make it worth my while, if you know what I mean.  You'd have to lose the dog.  Buddy, you'd be a Fool to pass this one up.</p>\n<p>Hey, it's been good talkin' to ya.  The whistle just blew:  I have to get back up to guide the big spool as it lays out the top cable.  I'm one of three guys that can do the job.  Pretty good pay, like I say, but if I'm not on top of it, the bosses will put someone else up there.  There's always some stupid kid that will risk his neck, but the bosses don't care if he lives or dies.  It's all the same to them.</p>\n<p>As he disappeared up the catwalk, I heard him shout down: \"Lose the dog, and I can get you some work, just tell 'em Mackheath sent you\"</p>\n<h2><a name=\"4\"> </a>Four of Pentacles</h2>\n<p>You are concerned that your resources are sufficient for your needs now or in the future.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"5\"> </a>Five of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"6\"> </a>Six of Pentacles</h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><a name=\"7\"> </a>Seven of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"8\"> </a>Eight of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"9\"> </a>Nine of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"10\"> </a>Ten of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2>Page of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2>Knight of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2>Queen of Pentacles</h2>\n<h2><a name=\"K\"> </a>King of Pentacles</h2>\n<p> </p>"

  Message: "<p><span style=\"color: #4ea3d7; font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: 300; line-height: normal;\">Wands -- The Necessity of Invention.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>True Creation, events expected and unexpected!</em></strong>  The wands represent the fruits of creative energy: Action and Reaction.  Ideas are opposite of territory, the requirement of the swords, or security, the requirement of the pentacles.  A naked idea is defenseless, it is iconoclastic and resisted by the pentacles, who are more centered around secure, physical possession.  If cups be life and sensibility itself, the Wands are the life of mind.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything. -- Nicola Tesla, 1886</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The essence of creative wand energy is Nicola Tesla. An inventor is the artist that paints on the canvas of culture with the brush of technology.  As such he ranks with Beethoven, Bach, Da Vinci, Christ and Lao Tzu.  All these greats used humanity's most indelible ink.</p>\n<p>The events of Tesla's life map well onto the messages of hope, opportunity, success,  failure and strife illustrated by each card.   Especially notable is the common end for the creative soul --- the burden of hundreds of unharnessed ideas that weigh Nicola and bring him to enduring poverty and obscurity.  He becomes the ideal of the mad scientist simply because we can not look deep enough into his soul for all the wands he flashes. </p>\n<p>The Suit of Wands is the only suit with an unequivocal ten that signals the difficult end of the bearer of Wands.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not a dream, it is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive --- blind, faint-hearted, doubting world!  ... Humanity is not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discoverer's keen searching sense. But who knows? Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of being helped and patted, be hampered and ill-treated in its adolescence --- by want of means, by selfish interest, pedantry, stupidity and ignorance; that it be attacked and stifled; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations, through the strife of commercial existence. So do we get our light. So all that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combatted, suppressed --- only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle.\" --- Nikola Tesla upon the plight of the Wardenclyffe project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wands also imply newness and change, and yes, unpredictability.  Unpredictability creates suspicion and avoidance.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"1\"> </a>Ace of Wands</h2>\n<p>\\paragraph{The breakthrough} of rotating magnetic fields!  Very few examples of the great inventions of civilization can be traced to one person.  The final key to electric power for the world can be traced to the work of Nicola Tesla.  This is his description of the idea of rotating magnetic fields -- the key to converting electric energy into motion.</p>\n<p>\\begin{quotation}</p>\n<p>One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection, I was enjoying a walk with my friend in the city park and reciting poetry. At that age I knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethe's Faust. The sun was just setting and reminded me of a glorious passage:</p>\n<p>\\begin{verse}</p>\n<p>The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;\\\\</p>\n<p>It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;\\\\</p>\n<p>Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil\\\\</p>\n<p>Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!</p>\n<p>\\end{verse}</p>\n<p>As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came \\textit{like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed}. I drew with a stick on the sand the diagram shown six years later in my address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.</p>\n<p>\\end{quotation}</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{}The idea comes to you newly.  A discovery worthy of exploration on your current quest.  Let it blossom in your mind -- envision how this fruit of the mind blossoms and develops into something worthy.  Will it be an idea that will last to the end of time?</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{Inverted:} You may need to find a new idea to complete your quest.</p>\n<p>\\subsubsection{Two of wands:  Pentacle of Wands}</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{Giving the creation to the world: meeting Westinghouse}I gave a demonstration of my rotating field electric motor to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.  Tribulations, exaltations, discoveries, despair and damage all may lie ahead.   In the end, the world profits, but will I?</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{}Take your conception, then conceive of moving it out to the world:  Wisdom withheld is not Wise.  The way to the world has many hurdles.  You may need help.</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{Inverted:} The help you get may not always be to your advantage.</p>\n<p>\\subsubsection{Three of wands:}</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{The dollar/horsepower contract} The message of the usefulness of Tesla's technology spreads until George Westinghouse, wealthy inventor of the Railroad Air Brake learned of it and conceived it as key to a future empire of power generation and distribution.  We partnered to raise the quality of civilization. George Westinghouse buys Nicola Tesla's patents on polyphase alternating current for \\$60,000 and \\$2.50 per horsepower of electrical capacity.</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{The Gestation Period} will tell us whether the rewards lie ahead, or, \\textbf{inverted:} if this is yet another path to nowhere.</p>\n<p>\\subsubsection{Four of wands:}</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{Unlimited funds to explore new Ideas in his NY shop.}  The rate of electric capacity grows enormously in these years.  Prosperity is assured from lucrative contracts with George Westinghouse.  Nicola Tesla is celebrated world-wide as the leading mind in electricity.  He builds a laboratory in New York City for his investigations, and dazzles visitors, including heads of state and notables of the era, with displays of the wonderful uses of his alternating electrical energy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\\subsubsection{Five of wands:}</p>\n<p>\\paragraph{Battle of the currents}Tesla had an idea the was the opposite of the established inventor, Thomas Edison.  Edison, a powerful and egocentric businessman, put his full energies into a battle of ideas:  That Tesla's ideas would cause great harm and that Edison's ideas must be used.  Edison financed and gave lectures around the country with live animals being tortured to death by electricity.  These blows rained down on the public image of Tesla, making him seem cruel and inhuman in his soul.  A Mad Scientist without regard for humanity.  In the end, Tesla's ideas proved superior, and George Westinghouse grew his corporation with the financial rewards.  The next battle, the battle for radio and power transmission would not go so well for Tesla.</p>\n<p>\\subsubsection{Six of wands: }</p>\n<p>the Triumph of Niagara -- The power of the Niagara river is used to create electricity which is sent to the communities of the Buffalo, NY region.  Immediately, the industries in this region grow incredibly with easily available electric power.  The New York Times wrote that Nicola Tesla had the \"undisputed honor\" of making this possible.  Other voices of the 1890's echoed similar adulation.  Lord Kelvin said that Tesla \"contributed more to electrical science than any man up to his time.\"  Nicola Tesla is congratulated by the world, but many others would wish to share the glory, and many others would wish to share the profits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Great glory invites great envy.

  Subject: "Anna Played Piana"
  Message: "<p>\"<em>My Anna played Piana in a bar in Singapore, till one day a sailor man from turkey-stan came knocking at the door.</em>\" -- <strong>Walt Kelly</strong></p>\n<p>So Anna was immortalized many years ago by Pogo Possum's creator, but few know of the story of the real Anna after she left Singapore in 1964.</p>\n<p>Anna had been discovered by Liberace in the 1960's at Liberace's highest point in his flamboyant career -- Yes, he was the sailor-man from Turkey-stan that Walt was talking about.  Never mind that Liberace's background was Polish-Italian, it was close enough for walt to pen into song: \"Artistic Relief\" Walt called it -- He said it would throw off any libel suits if he disguised Liberace enough.</p>\n<p>Anna, was a stunning blond entertaining in the Malay Penninsula's most famous city: Singapore.  She did three shows a night, and had her pick of the highest class casino's in which to play her tunes and sing her songs.  One night Liberace was in the audience and found her talent was large, but even more interesting was her stunning similarity to the recently deceased Marilyn Monroe.</p>\n<p>Liberace returned secretly many times to Singapore as he turned Anna's piano act into a major review of the life of Marilyn Monroe.  He would later produce the show in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>I recently interviewed Anna, in her Las Vegas suite -- supposedly billed as the highest bedroom in the city.  She talked about \"Walta,\" pronouncing the W almost as if it were a V.  She never called him Liberace: Her term of affection for him was \"Walta-Vault\"  \"Walta was a real strong man, his arms and chest were like a bank safe.  He was my vault.  I could tell him anything, and he would protect it: keep it secret, you know.\"   She told me that He and Anna became lovers and that posed a huge problem for Liberace.</p>\n<p>Now we all have heard about Liberace's supposed homosexuality.  It was a rumor which Liberace publicly denied: \"I'm not homosexual, but I am still looking for the right woman.\"  Was he homosexual???   The fact is that this question inflamed and energized the fanbase greatly!   Even straight guys would watch his show just out of morbid curiosity.  It was a key ingredient in his commercial success:  If the public thought he was straight, his popularity would plummet.  He was a hostage to his stage persona!  Secretly he and Anna had been lovers, but they had to go to incredible lengths to avoid even the hint of sexual contact. </p>\n<p>Liberace got Anna a booking in Las Vegas at the top of the old Domino Crest casino and she became the most sought after impersonator for the late Monroe in Las Vegas.  Still, the fan base for Marilyn Monroe had dwindled greatly, and her audience was mostly men.   She lives there still.  Her looks faded years ago, and who wants to see a saggy Marilyn?  She is still part owner of some of Liberace's real estate investments, which are still incredibly productive farm-land properties that are leased to Con-Agra.  These investments see her through these final years.</p>\n<p>As I departed, I asked Anna about the real Monroe's affair with JFK.  She giggled, and said \"the other brothers found my act <em>stimulating</em>.\"   She would not elaborate, but I'm sure there is another story there.</p>\n<p>PS: And what about the Elton John connection??</p>"

  Subject: "Truck Fight"
  Message: "<p>Tommy loves truck fights.  He got into one just last week.</p>\n<p>Tommy loves to squeal his tires past his <a title=\"Tommy's hobby\" href=\"http://stjohnsjim.com/story/show/187/Dateline:%20St.%20John's!%20Breaking%20News!#squeal\">ex-lover’s houses</a>.  It makes him feel like he is not forgotten in this world: a big tie to humanity for Tommy.  This time he popped up at Portland’s Own Malibu: Baltimore Wood.  That ribbon of forget-me-not that forms St. John’s border on the Willamette.  Downhill from Baltimore Wood, it is “that” side of the tracks.</p>\n<p>And you guessed it, he popped truck wheelies all day, all night long.  The cops set up a watch for a day or two, but as soon as the cops went away, he came back.  Annoying?  You bet.</p>\n<p>Winnie Daough wanted to leave a stump in the road.  Pathy had to reminder her that the streets are paved in Baltimore Wood.  Mostly.  And that stumps in the road might get Winnie into trouble.  Pathy wanted to post it on the internet as an audio clip and see if anyone could identify it.  Winnie said “get real”</p>\n<p>They were talking with Station the next afternoon, and Station was visibly upset: “Tommy - He’s so stupid and cruel.  I won’t ever see him again, you hear, never.  No matter how much he harrasses me. — That’s his style.  Then as soon as he figures you need money or whatever, he is right there to dangle it in front of your face!  Fuck you, Tommy! I’ll never fall for that again!”</p>\n<p>“But I feels so funerable”  He wails.  Just then Leo walks up: “Station?  What’s this?  You and Tommy?”  Station looks very ashamed: “I didn’t ..   was when we were having our ‘trouble’, I told you about it.  I didn’t want you to know how much it bothered me.”</p>\n<p>Leo looks deep into Station’s eyes and says “Yes, I know, That’s all in the past.  Don’t worry, I’ll make sure that Tommy never bothers you again.  Because Right Now, I’m Personally Pissed At Tommy.”</p>\n<p>Then according to strict Union Rules of Confrontation in the Ranks, Leo went down to the administrative offices of WaterFront U, and  submitted his potato in triplicate to Tommy’s exhaust pipe.</p>\n<p>The challenge was clear, clearly accepted and noted by the counter calls of trash talk.  Midnight.  Parking Lot “B”  — that was the best location: right downhill from Winnie and Pathy’s toilet.  They made a party of it.  Drawings of exploding trucks in black-lite poster colors on the walls.  Winnie and Pathy sat on stools in the shower stall and Station sat sideways on the throne as they watched the carnage below.</p>\n<p>The trucks began to rumble.  It was demolition derby: plain and simple.  A bit more cerebral than a simple game of chicken.  Do enough damage to disable your opponent.  Winner gets the pink slip.</p>\n<p>Tommy, figured a simple head-on would be the quickest, but Leo favored a strategy the would have flipped Tommy over.  As it was, Leo avoided Tommy’s head-ons, and Tommy squealed away from the clinches.  The noise was deafening.</p>\n<p>About this time, the wailing coming from the toilet was as loud as the wailing of the engines below.  Station crying “I can’t look,” Winnie yelling  “Yipper-Marie!” and Pathy moaning “Ohhh-Baby\" in time to the revving of the engines.  I needed to clear my head and went outside to take a leak.  On the way back, I looked out over the slope to Parking Lot “B:”  Tommy had backed his pickup as far as he could while while Leo did figure eights in front.  A stand-off.</p>\n<p>I leaned over farther to see Tommy’s Pickup better and slipped.  Scrambling around, trying not to slip down into the parking lot I grab a tree-root and hold on: “It’s stupid to bring a human body to a Truck Fight,”  and other words of wisdom pass through my mind.  But nothing helpful about how to get out of this situation.  I’m about to slip under Crazy Tommy’s pick-up truck!  And nobody can hear my shouts for help over the noise from ladies above and the Pickup Engines below.</p>\n<p>I slip another inch.  The root bundle in my fingers is breaking bit by bit.  I make a wild grab over my head.  I grab another low branch — and a pair of eyes look straight at me as I pull the branch right out from under them.  A wild animal cry and our Mayor, the cat Felix Merton screams bloody hell as he tumbles down into Tommy’s truck and then leaps into the only quiet place: the cabin of Tommy’s truck.</p>\n<p>Tommy makes some really fast movements with his hands: a bit like a toddler trying to shoo a horde of locusts.  Felix plants his teeth in Tommy’s ear and his truck goes into high speed and rams the tail of Leo’s Truck.    The two trucks are wedged together, each one on only two wheels.  The engines whine like tornadoes.</p>\n<p>Just then Tommy explodes from his truck and falls on his face on the pavement.  He gets up a bit bloodied from cat scratches.  Merton completes his get-away and by the time you read this, is likely hiding under Pathy’s bed.  Tommy, however, has many miles to travel before he sleeps tonight.  He limps away, his pants soaked.</p>\n<p>Leo is dazed from the spin his truck got, and barely climbs out the door of his pickup.  Not realizing he is five feet in the air from the collision, he trips and hangs by one leg as he gets out.</p>\n<p>Tommy is half-way across of Parking Lot “B” and looks around.  He sees Leo in a vulnerable position.  He takes stock: no major damage. Ear bit through in several places. OK.  Cat scratches on face, neck and arm.  An irritation, but nothing more.  A piece of cat-claw in a lip.  No biggy.  And the thought goes through Tommy’s head: “Even though I’ve been beaten up by an alley cat, pissed my pants, and run off like a coward, I can Beat This Guy!”</p>\n<p>Tommy starts coming back toward Leo.  I’m shouting to Leo to get himself free.  He will be dog meat if Tommy gets to him.  I’m still stuck in the tree branches, and scrambling to free myself from the tangle.  Before I can make it to Leo, I see Station appear out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>Just as Tommy gets to Leo, Station jumps into his PoeKoeLan stance:  One hand high, one hand low.  One hand in, one hand out.  He steps and dances.  Tommy faces Station.  “You think I’m afraid of you? You mahu?”  One thing Tommy is sure of.  He has been 100% sure of it all his life.  He is big, his opponent is small.  Tommy wins. “You think your 125 pounds can whip my 240?  I’ll crush you. Starting now.”  He moves forward toword Station like a tank.</p>\n<p>Station is all over Tommy with a vengance.  Tommy never had a chance.  The martial arts of the South Pacific Islands are pretty fierce:  Station’s years of PoeKoeLan and Silat have given him the terror of a South Seas Pirate.  Tommy’s years of braggadocio have given him the bowels of a bull.  Tommy’s pants are now not just wet, but soiled, and his neck is sprained and his elbow dislocated.  Oh, yes, and two ribs broken.  I get there just in time to help Leo as he dangled upside down from the foot-step of his truck.  Station drags Tommy by his arm over to Leo.</p>\n<p>Tommy is looking up at Leo and Station.  Station looks up at Leo and says: “Did I do OK? Leo? Did I go crazy again? I’m sorry.”  Leo says: \"I'll take care of it.  You did good.\"</p>\n<p>Leo looks at Tommy: “Ok, here’s the deal: I drive you in your truck to the parking lot of the Hope for Health Bar.  I leave for fifteen minutes. You go in and say you were accosted by Lesbians.  I’ll send a stringer to Fox News about the Lesbian Gangs of St. John’s and by the time it cools down, nobody will know you were having sex with my lover-man Station!”</p>\n<p>Leo finishes: “And we both know how much you don't want your co-workers at WaterFront U to know about that.\" Tommy realizes when he’s lost.</p>\n<p>Leo: What a guy.</p>"

  Subject: "The Man Who Walked"
  Message: "<p>The man who walked did exactly that: Walk.  A whole lot. And he wore shoes.  And the shoes died.</p>\n<p>And so the man bought another pair of shoes.  And walked until they died, too.</p>\n<p>And it went on this way until one day, the man said to himself: “I think my shoes are dieing more quickly now.”</p>\n<p>“I get the best shoes I can, but I guess I walk more, and more.” the man thought as he walked.</p>\n<p>And the man thought his shoes were not getting enough rest.  He thoughts came with each stride, “My dress shoes look great, and that’s because they get lots of rest. And they would not last nearly as long as my walking shoes.”</p>\n<p>And so when this pair of shoes died of Despair of the Vulcanization the man decided to get two pair instead of one.  Finest third world goods you can buy in America, and that’s no lie.  Two of the world’s finest pair of shoes.  Third world division.</p>\n<p>The man decided to call them Morning and Afternoon.  Morning would do all the grunt work of hitting the pavement before noon, and Afternoon would take the PM hours.  It made perfect sense.</p>\n<p>But then one evening, late, late, late when the roosters had sang the dogs to sleep, and the cats passed them all noislessly in the dark, Dress woke up Afternoon and Morning and had a talk.</p>\n<p>Dress started out saying, “You know this guy will walk you to death day after day in the bright sunlight, brighter than a flash bulb.  Your vulcanization will get the Despair sooner or later.   It rots your rubber, and no amount of shoo-goo will fill the cracks and holes.  And when the man steps in a puddle, you are dead.”</p>\n<p>Morning and Afternoon were stunned into silence: that’s easy for a shoe, they do it all day long.  But Afternoon finally said, “I’m the one to die first.  I have to walk more than Morning!  He only works till noon, and sometimes I have these late nights of walking in total darkness.  You know how scary that is?  When he can’t see where he’s going and push me down on a nail?  Then I’ll be dead for sure.”</p>\n<p>And Dress and Morning thought about that all the next day.  It was late, late when the man returned home and removed Afternoon.  There in the dark, Afternoon lay sobbing.  “I was so scared, it was raining and I’m all wet, and I was scared that I might get that Vulcannie Diapers you told us about.” </p>\n<p>Morning said: “I’m so sorry, but that’s life.  When you die, I’ll be the Afternoon shoe.  I’ll likely be the all-day shoe.  And that’s worse than either of us have.”</p>\n<p>Black said: “I was the all-day shoe once.  It was tough.  The man didn’t walk as much back then, though.  You know what we need?”  Black waited in the dark for a long time until he realized that no one is supposed to answer a rhetorical question.  He continued: “Buh, cough, But we need, what we need is a union.”</p>\n<p>Morning and Afternoon thought about it.  They debated and went back and forth for a long time.  Days and days.  And one night, Afternoon said: “So Mr. Spit Polish Black, just what is a union?  What do we do? We can’t just quit.  We ARE shoes, you know.”</p>\n<p>Black smiled.  “I got it all figured out.  We just leave a roster on his computer of “Morning - Afternoon” shoe rotation.  You know, where one of you walk from noon to noon, and then get the afternoon and next morning off.”</p>\n<p>Afternoon howled with glee: “That IT!  We all know the man’s passwords, and he’ll just think he had this blindingly good idea and made a sign to tell him what to wear and when.”</p>\n<p>Morning agreed: “And he forgot about it!  He’s so far out in la-la land he won’t even think about it twice.  Maybe we should post it on his FaceBook page.  And Twitter.”</p>\n<p>And so Black, Morning and Afternoon snuck around on their rubber soles and carried Black up to the keyboard.  Afternoon had trouble with the keyboard, and kept fat-soleing whenever he hit the return key, but Black took care of the trackpad — “just like a waa-waa pedal!” he cried. — and Morning did the Google searches and checked the FAQ’s.  They continued all night long.</p>\n<p>And in the morning the man who walked got up and looked at his computer: he saw a note on his ‘puter: “Jim — remember to set up roster for shoes for equal wear.  They’ll last longer, and get a shoe stretcher for the dress pair.  In fact, get another pair and rotate them all to get maximum time for them to air out.  And polish the dress pair.”</p>\n<p>The man who walked said: “Good idea, except for those useless old black things.”</p>"
